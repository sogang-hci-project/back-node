ABSTRACT
This thesis is an analys. ##is of electric light. and depictions of the light bulb in Pablo Picasso’s oeuvre beginning with two. ##cubist works from 191. 2 and 1914, and recurring with great significance in 1935, reaching a symboli. ##c apogee in the masterp. iece, Guernica, 1937, and thereafter granting its continued importance in w. ##ar-time and post-war stil. l lifes. The overlooked importance of the light bulb—the only technologic. ##al element in a vast repert. oire of figures founded upon Antiquity, Alchemy, various mythologies an. ##d everyday items that took hi. ghly symbolic form in his portraiture, still lifes, and other genre s. ##cenes—is considered for the dia. chronic mode of its dispersal with respect to the specific contexts. ##in which it is seen. The filamen. t light bulb conjoins other important themes in Picasso’s work, b. ##ut it is distinguished in all circu. mstances through a conception of malevolence and evil and the b. ##reakdown of the natural order of the. world as he saw it; that is, as a devolution of the domain of. ##light as the common Good, as a waning. life force. Electric light is taken along side Picasso’s “can. ##dles of war” that evolve from his adept. and keen awareness of the symbolic power of light as a prog. ##eny in Barcelona in 1895.
Written in fiv. e illustrated chapters, the dissertation begins with an ov. ##erview of the impact that electric light h. ad had upon late nineteenth and early twentieth century. ##life, in Paris in particular, as a scientifi. c advancement, par excellence, and as a new cultural i. ##con. Walter Benjamin’s thesis on the Marxist n. otion of the phantasmagoria is considered apropos th. ##e exceptional electric lighting campaigns of the. Paris World Expositions of 1881 and 1900 in which. ##various advancements in the technology of the lig. ht bulb contributed to the sense of overall “blin. ##ding” as a pacification of the masses. This prologu. e builds to an analysis of Guernica that premie. ##red at the Spanish Republic Pavilion in the Paris Exp. osition Universelle

of 1937 amidst an incand. ##escent extravaganza that was adroitly organized for soc. iopolitical, capitalist, and fascist agenda. ##s, especially by the Third Reich who utilized lighting pr. ograms as a tool of propaganda. In that t. ##he light in Guernica is a panoptical eye powered by a singl. e, dangling bulb, Picasso countered the. ##prevailing excessive theatrical incandescent culture with an. image that has become one of the most. ##potent anti-war icons of the warring twentieth century: the e. lectric sun.
The thesis takes into a. ##ccount alterations of the sun as a degraded, inverted, and mocke. d signifier of sacred light. I dem. ##onstrate that from 1930 to the conclusion of Guernica in June of ‘. 37 how images of the sun were ce. ##ntral to Picasso’s ongoing ire against the war in Spain and the burg. eoning realities of fascist ag. ##gression in pre-World War II France. Given the extraordinary lambency. of incandescence and its symb. ##olic impact, beyond the real ways in which it reshaped perception in ea. rly modern life, expressed. ##in every epoch of modernism, including cubism, futurism, rayonism, surrea. lism, constructivism, and. ##vorticism, and in the literary arts, heterogeneous types of electric light. and light bulbs may be. ##claimed as the most singularly potent emblems of new utopias and tomorrows b. orne from the catastro. ##phic strain caused by the Great War and the interwar years leading up to the S. panish Civil War and. ##World War II. In that Picasso’s light bulbs are taken for their explicit corres. pondence to acts o. ##f violence, scenes of death and sacrifice, and as a penultimate signifier of darkn. ess-in-the-light. ##, the dissertation identifies the “seraphim light bulbs” of bullfight scenes from 19. 34-35 that hav. ##e not been recognized and are indisputable precursors to the electric sun in Guernica.. Furthermore,. ##attention has been paid to the morphology of the wire filament both in 1914, identifie. d as the “F. ##ilament-Harlequin,” and in 1937, in which I identify the filament in the electric sun as. an approxi. ##mation of the Luftwaffe flight patterns for the aerial bombing scheme in the destruction o. f the Ba. ##sque village, Gernika.

This dissertation was begun during my graduate s. tu. ##dies with the late Lydia Gasman from 1992-1999. It was in the realm of her authority as the schola.. ##r who had decoded the deepest implications of Picasso’s surrealist period writings and iconography,.. ##applying aplomb of genius to the stratum of conflicts inherent to that work that I was initiated in. ##. the depths of his protean art. Under Lydia’s particular beam, I benefited from her tempestuous mag. ##ic. , and mystery, in ways that are still coming into form. As her final doctoral student at Virgini. ##a, s. he did not oversee my late-in-coming dissertation that owes so very much to her life’s work. A. ##s Dr.. Gasman had said of Meyer Schapiro, whom she studied with at Columbia, I am also very fortunat. ##e for t. he “unforgettable experience” of studying with her.
During the years in which I was ABD, I. ##was Instr. uctor in Modern Art at the Edinburgh College of Art (Scotland); and, served as a two-time. ##museum dir. ector at the Cornell Fine Arts Museum at Rollins College (Florida) and the University o. ##f New Mexico. Art Museum. During my tenures in those institutions (2005-2012) my work as an art hist. ##orian included. the authoring, co-authoring or editing of over ten publications including, Eva Hesse. ##Spectres 1960. (Yale Press 2010) and Corps Exquis: Fragments from a History of the Human Form, 1585. ##-2006 (Rollins 2. 008); curating or organizing over twenty-nine exhibitions; and, overseeing ancilla. ##ry projects includ. ing the creation of the Distinguished Visiting Scholars Program at the UNM Art M. ##useum, Albuquerque.. vi

Resuming the dissertation in 2012 was made wholly possible due to the un. ##flagging support and. friendship of David Summers, William R. Kenan Professor of Art History, and Pa. ##ul Barolsky, Commonwea. lth Professor of Art History who encouraged the work to completion. I remain. ##grateful for their bril. liance in the art of writing and their expertise in the long history of im. ##age making. I learned of e. kphrasis from Paul and the beauty of the intertwined voices of poetry an. ##d art that herald the soul w. hich he so eloquently spoke about in seminar. From David Summers, I de. ##veloped a mind for the linkage. between works of art to larger concerns, of the ways in which philos. ##ophical thought girds enquiries. that are otherwise purely visual, and that expansive approach has i. ##n itself been enormously rewardi. ng under his tutelage. It was he who sparked my imagination with t. ##he phrase, “drawing as if to posse. ss,” said by Picasso, which David applied in his explication of. ##a drawing by Rembrandt. If possessio. n was a factor in an artist’s realization of his subject, in s. ##uch a way that the occurrence of signa. ture styles and the reasons for modes of expression material. ##ized, just how that might mean drove my. curiousity. Such were those rich times in Charlottesville.. ##At this later hour in my relationship to. the University I would like to express my thanks and since. ##re gratitude to University Professor in Ar. t History, Elizabeth Hutton Turner, and Jessica Feldman,. ##Professor of English who served on the thes. is committee as essential readers of the dissertation. ##in its final form and contributed their expert. ises to the defense conversation.

INTRODUCTION
This thesis is conc. ##erned with a mostly overlooked although inargua. bly vital element in Picasso’s oeuvre, that of the. ##light bulb and the cast of electric radiance real. ized in a variety of works from 1912 to 1937. The. ##se dates are bracketed by war, which is the corresp. onding causality in the formation of the ampoul. ##es électriques in the works of art chosen for this di. scussion. The Balkan Wars headlined European. ##news during the breakthrough of cubist papiers collés o. f 1912; the Great War exploded in July of 1. ##914 in which the second phase of cubism, synthetic cubism. took form; and, Picasso’s work in the Spa. ##nish Civil War period crescendoed after the aerial bombing. of Gernika, on April 26, 1937 with the c. ##reation of Guernica. In the adaptation and manipulation of. the light bulb as image, bearing in mind. ##its particular type of radiance, the object was wrought—as. light is in all cases—as a reflection o. ##f private and world conditions. In each of these phases of Pi. casso’s work, use for the light bulb. ##found its place in contexts of aggression, unwarranted killings. , personal loss, and protracted bat. ##tles. In those pictorial accounts, technological light was a meas. ure of humankind gone wrong.
For. ##Picasso, whose acute attention about the illumination of oil and ga. s lamps, candles, and suns that. ##took various forms, the focus in this study upon incandescent light. is regarded as an aspect of pa. ##rticular realms of threat, destruction, and death. Specifically, durin. g the pre-Spanish Civil War. ##years that lead in to World War II, his symbolic socio- aesthetic founde. d a veritable taxonomy of. ##modern light with the light bulb and the degraded sun as central features.. The essential nature of. ##electric light, and the imagistic depictions of it have been largely under. examined, with the excep. ##tion of Jean Boggs work in Picasso & Things in which the light in still life. s received descriptive. ##attention. Yet, when considered

against the weight of analyses of style and. genre in varying meth. ##odologies that have persisted in the critical record, the essential factor of i. ncandescent light i. ##n Picasso’s art has received less attention.
The dissertation attempts an iconolo. gical analysis of. ##the interrelation between electric light and Picasso’s fictive solar narratives th. at included the. ##adaptation of certain tenets of Alchemy, Christian and pagan mythologies, and Antiqu. ity that are. ##counterpoints to technological light. Considered as the “negative” polarity in the play. of opposite. ##s that the works present the thesis encompasses a historical account of the evolution of. electricit. ##y in modern culture, aestheticized through the actual object of electric lamps in anthrop. o- morphi. ##zed and highly symbolic modes. As a subject of utopian tomorrows the transformational promi. se of e. ##lectric filament light is also considered for its service in the prevailing capitalist and wa. rring. ##twentieth century. Certainly the central disembodied eye of
the electric sun of Guernica holds. a s. ##trong machine focus that emits the sending power of its highly original force. A scrutiny of the. su. ##n reveals it casts its own black
shadow, but in reverse so as to invert a natural law of radiance. .. ##Black-rays emanate behind the solid sun-shape. In effect they appear to cut into the background “s.. ##creen” that is the stage-space of the huge painting. The rays then, blacker than the black backgrou. ##n. d painted throughout Guernica are an altogether different darkness. In this straightforward obser. ##vat. ion lies a summation of Picasso’s inversion of light, in service to his lengthy campaign with t. ##he li. ght bulb that had begun in 1912. Most importantly, the cast shadow of the electric sun was ca. ##used by. a source of radiance brighter than the sun itself that shines upon it and beyond of it from. ##a sourc. e that we imagine directly faces it.

The floating eye-sun recalls Odilon Redon’s g. ##reat hover. ing eyeballs, such as, The Eye Like A Strange Balloon, 1882, in which the Cyclopean moti. ##f of late ni. neteenth century Symbolism would become important and subsumed in Surrealist
practices. ##of which Guer. nica may not be discounted among. Cut-
away from the body this eye infers the beginn. ##ing of its seeki. ng
attachment to another, to foreign bodies or a location in unique
environments.. ##In that Redon’s ae. rial eye, an instance of the eyeball-
skyball of Platonic thought in which the s. ##un dominates the wor. ld
with intelligible clarity, the twist in early twentieth century modernist d. ##oubt saw the floating. airborne eye as a panoptical device and an Oedipal trope. Although “Guernica. ##in the Shadow of Incand. escence” does not include Freudian readings of the Oedipal eye, it does how. ##ever consider the eye-pan. opticon for its “seer” function related to insight and prescient advice,. ##the third or pineal eye of. divine wisdom; and, as a predatory surveillance machine that scoped the. ##evidence of the Luftwaffe’s. bombing of Gernika while it also succeeded in
stripping away autonomy a. ##nd rights to privacy. During. Picasso’s great campaign of monumental sculptures made in Boisgeloup i. ##n 1932 and 1933 the portrait b. ust took form as stony composites of facial features. In a fragment. ##that appears to be from antiquit. y rather than an artist’s studio in the 1930s, a small plaster car. ##ving of
a single eye, simply L’œil. , 1932, that is a disembodied eye of surrealism that avails its. ##mutila- tion therefore blinding in t. he great bronze La femme au vase that will stand at the entran. ##ce to the Spanish Pavilion at the Pari. s Exposition of ’37 and in its final resting place of Picass. ##o’s grave at his chateau in Vauvenargues. .

Apropos the sacred eye, Picasso derived from hi. ##s Spanish heritage experience of the gaze. of the Panocrator. In his return to Barcelona in 1934 he. ##reencountered the grand Catalanian ruling C. hrist in the apse of Sant Climent de Taüll. The eyes of. ##God are set directly upon the viewer, which. like the singular eye in Guernica emphasizes the inesc. ##apable
dominance of their fixity. The all-seei. ng omnipotent divine eye may also be Luciferian, dar. ##k light inferred in the technological inversion. that the electric sun was made to be in 1937. Throu. ##ghout many of Picasso’s wartime writings the sun. will be an evil sun.
When in ’37 he had felt overw. ##helmed by Franco’s ever-darkening swath through Sp. ain, his conception of space changed altogether. ##and this infers a sense of the cosmological expanse. of evil that was metaphorically crammed into cl. ##austrophic, over-populated rooms. As Alfred Barr, Jr.. noted, “Such a transformation expressed Guern. ##ica’s focus on the forces of evil.”1
We may ask then,. given the importance of electric light in Pic. ##asso’s work that the thesis purports, how did the light. bulb get scripted into his complex visual v. ##ocabulary? Chapter One: “Dark Paradises of Incandescence. ” is a summarization of the new technology. ##of arc lamp lighting and tungsten filament lamps that ach. ieved world notoriety from Parisian expo. ##sitions in the late nineteenth century, that in turn served. to construct urban life and expand soci. ##o-political agendas. In that incandescent programs were glori. fied in French culture par excellence. ##, in which Edison’s lamps had prevailed at the Paris Exposition. of 1888. A foundational appreciatio. ##n of the early science and promotion of artificial light is inst. ructive for the reevaluation of Gu. ##ernica. In its symbolic capacity, intertwined with capitalism and. nationalistic propagandas, incand. ##escence light was no other spectacle. In that 1 Alfred J. Barr, Jr..

it will acq. uire a form of autonomy, regar. ##ded here as “performance,” Picasso’s articulation of the light bulb in. cluded fashioning the filame. ##nt for its performativity qualities as metaphor and sign. The simple pro. perties of the bulb were n. ##ot overlooked as the material aspect of an object otherwise imbued with an. imated properties.
Witho. ##ut resorting to sketches or preparatory models toward a development in the m. orphology or transform. ##ations of electric bulbs, they were otherewise seemingly instantly conceived a. s whole and finite i. ##mages. As if Picasso knew the light bulb, despite his complete dislike of it, he. was adept with its. ##properties like those of the harlequin, bull and horse, the candle, and the sun.. As the thesis sug. ##gests, the filaments would acquire specific traits that carried the total meaning. of the light bulb. ##in the worlds that Picasso created for them. He was aware of the types of common l. ight bulbs in 1. ##912, and again in 1914, the Filament- Harlequin being loosely based upon the filament. construction. ##of the 1910 squirrel-cage bulb, also known as a Marconi lamp. In Picasso’s imagination. , the wires. ##were Harlequin’s motley and the entire squared network of tungsten filament the whole st. anding com. ##media dell’arte figure. The quotidian bulb was a surround of glass, the housing for its fi. lament w. ##as wholly important in the sense that if the wires were not entirely closed, “...air would g. radual. ##ly leak into the bulb and destroy the light.” The essential balance of interior/exterior; powe. r/ne. ##gation of power; light/darkness conveyed as good/evil were inherent in Picasso’s bulbs. In an ob. sc. ##ure document from 1913, the “Secrets of Leading in Wires” revealed that electrical scientists rega.. ##rded them as “line of communication between the air outside and the vacuum inside.”
What circumscrib. ##. es the thesis is an attention upon duality seen in Picasso’s own selection of sun versus light bul. ##b;. electric sun versus candle light; le soleil noir, the black sun of melancholy versus Good light;. ##sa. crifice and the sun of Christ versus the sun of the Mithraic

bull in ritual, and so on.. ##These. factors are discussed at length in chapters two and five respectively, “Illuminating War: Bla. ##ck Sun. , Electric Sun” and “Guernica in the Conflict of Radiance.” In between these chapters I felt. ##it impo. rtant to position Picasso’s light bulbs within the larger demonstration of them in early m. ##odern Euro. pean and Russian art and tangentially, in its literature, included sparsely despite its. ##great import. ance. The third chapter, “Making Light Avant-Garde” is a sweeping account of the leitm. ##otif of the li. ght bulb in modern art, ca. 1909-1925 in which, as I state, it’s “poetic-subjective. ##voice coincided. with the point at which the mystery of its agency was conveyed through utopian rhet. ##oric and anthropo. morphic”2 configurations of automata that did not obey any sense of figural stand. ##ardizations. Given. the timeline the lights of war convey the deepest sense of the desperate qualiti. ##es of incandescence. in desperate circumstances.
By the mid-1930s the light bulb will reappears in P. ##icasso’s work followi. ng a near twenty-year hiatus. Perhaps the most profound discovery about elect. ##ric light in this resea. rch effort has been the revelations of a group of fairly disguised light bu. ##lbs-as-angels that hover. above terribly vicious ordeals between bull and horse from 1934-35. I have. ##called these aerial figur. es “seraphim light bulbs,” and develop their importance as agents of a c. ##oalesced divine/profane ligh. t that prefigures the electric sun of Guernica. I have not found in th. ##e work of any other author on. the subject of the corrida; the characterization of Marie-Thérèse in. ##the guise of the candleholder a. nd “companion” character of the angels; studies on Guernica, includ. ##ing the comprehensive text, Picas. so 1927-1939: From the Minotaur to Guernica by Josep i Palau Fabr. ##e, an authority on the period, any. recognition of the electric seraphim. These are respectfully sub. ##mitted for consideration here, then,. for the first time as part of the discourse that attempts a co. ##ntribution to a richer understanding. of Picasso and light.

Ultimately, this. ##thesis is about seeing. Picasso distu. rbed the sense of it, turning our attention to modes of inve. ##rted light, obliterated light, electric. light, reconfigured and degraded light. But as I conclude i. ##n chapter five, as a man of the Spanish s. un he does not forego the power of sunlight and its life-. ##sustaining essence in his Romanesque chapel. painting, Le paix, 1955. We come to know Picasso’s ligh. ##t bulbs in the threats to the natural order. of things that he perceived in the time in which he liv. ##ed.
Perhaps no more eloquently stated is Hans. Blumenberg’s renowned summary of the real, poetic, an. ##d metaphysical properties of light that is wor. thwhile to repeat vis-à-vis Picasso’s incessantly po. ##werful radiance:
Light can be a directed beam, a. guiding beacon in the dark, an advancing dethronem. ##ent of darkness, but also a dazzling super-abunda. nce, as well as an indefinite, omnipresent bright. ##ness containing all: the ‘letting-appear’ that does. not itself appear, the inaccessible accessibili. ##ty of things. Light and darkness can represent the a. bsolute metaphysical counterforces that exclud. ##e each other and yet brighten the world constellation. into existence.
Or, light is the absolute pow. ##er of Being, which reveals the paltriness of the dark,. which can no longer exist once light has com. ##e to existence. Light is intrusive; in its abundance, it. creates the overwhelming, conspicuous clar. ##ity with which the true ‘comes forth’; it forcibly acquir. es the irrevocability of Spirit’s consent. ##. Light remains what it is while letting the infinite parti. cipate in it; it is consumption without. ##loss.
Light produces space, distance, orientation, calm cont. emplation; it is the gift that makes. ##no demands, the illumination capable of conquering without forc. e.3

The 1937 Paris World Fair, formally k. nown as the Exposition Intern. ##ationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Modern, was a strategic gam. ble by France that was host. ##ed during a fractious and threatening period (fig. 1). In 1932, during in. itial discussions about t. ##he scope and feasibility of another Paris-based world fair, the organizing. committee and government. ##al authorities proffered that the enterprise would reinvigorate France from. a lingering pall caused. ##by the tremendous death toll of the Great War, and, the dire economy5 caused. by the American Great. ##Depression. The admixture of financial crisis and societal torpor was reason. enough, according to. ##the fair’s organizers and France’s then-current government to push the project. forward.

A mere five weeks had passed since the aerial bombardments by the Condor Legion of. the. ##Luftwaffe had destroyed the Basque village of Gernika. An estimated sixteen hundred people were. kil. ##led and an additional eight hundred were wounded in various degrees of severity. Europe, by May. of. ##1937 was teetering on the edge of widespread catastrophe. Notwithstanding the palpable realities. of. ##the atrocities in Spain, and the advance of Nazi aggression, France maintained a non-intervention.. ##ist policy toward Franco’s reign of Nationalist terror; and, a policy of détente toward the Third Re. ##. ich.
During the late interwar rappel à l’ordre of 1930 to 1936, the unstable French government had. ##h. ad a procession of twelve prime ministers who served six different parties.6 The narrow victory. ##of t. he Popular Front on June 4 brought France’s first Jewish and first Socialist prime minister, L. ##éon Bl. um, to power and in due course he immediately merged the Socialist, Communist, and Radical p. ##arties.. Blum’s leadership on foreign policy followed in league with his several predecessors; and,. ##in the Ra. ssemblement Populaire, or General Assembly, plans outlined that nothing was to be controv. ##ersial or e. xplicitly confrontational regarding the Third Reich. The Germans, however, considered t. ##he olive bran. ch a sign of weakness and indeterminacy despite not saying so. The French ambassador. ##to Berlin, Andr. é François-Poncet, keenly noticed that it was, “Precisely because they [Germans] be. ##lieve that a trag. ic period of our history is going to begin, because they discount

...ther. e was more than enough material for diagnosing the decline of Fre. ##nch society in 1937. On a world sta. ge, France was exposed as a riven country... factionalized by c. ##onflicting responses to youth and inn. ovation and conflicting attitudes to the urban and the rural,. ##the industrial and the traditional.

In accord with the general strategy. ##of rapprochement an invitation was extende. d to the Nazi government to participate in the Expositi. ##on as early as 1934. By ’36, the Front Popula. ire was in pursuit of Germany’s involvement with cord. ##ial assertiveness. The boldness of French coope. ration with Hitler’s regime was magnified by the Re. ##ich’s current record of aggression and killings;. yet, there is no mention in the extant records of. ##the German occupation of the Rhineland, nor of the. Nazi involvement in the Spanish Civil War, that. ##confirms this. The ongoing loss of lives did not fi. gure in to the desperate if not naïve aspiratio. ##ns of the fair’s organizers and the French Left. In a. n outlandish turn of logic given the Reich’s. ##complicity with Franco; and, other atrocities committed. at the Dachau since 1933, the French believ. ##ed that a German pavilion would be of pronounced politic. al importance. Upholding the Reich’s escal. ##ating self-styled prestige, it was determined that their p. articipation would produce “the necessar. ##y psychological preconditions” in France for instigating new. trade relations.

But it is only because these possibilities for directed light were discovered. ##at all, that. the technology for this discovery could ultimately make possible the most violent of. ##methods and de. vices: and it is significant that the term lighting is used to refer to thoughtless. ##accentuation by. artificial light, as well as to the technological selection and overemphasis of the. ##work of man, whi. ch—as the only things thought to be worth seeing—is to be made impossible to over. ##look. ...”lighting”. has imposed, in many forms, an ‘optics’ that goes against his will—is the histo. ##rical antipode of th. e classical contemplator caeli [surveyor of the heavens] and his freedom to ga. ##ze.34

In general technic. ##al terms, the blinding effects of s. treet lighting, termed “glare”35 were chiefly conditioned by to. ##tal candlepower emitted by each light. ing unit directed toward the eye; by the angle with the line. ##of vision at which the beam enters the. eye and the number of units; and, the mounting height of the. ##lamps and spacing between them. Control. led “blinding” is an operation of surveillance in which th. ##e seen subject, whose sight is shrouded, t. runcated, or blinded represents the alterations to visio. ##n in structures of control. Fourteen years a. fter the Battles of the Fronde— a series of civil wars. ##(1648-1653) that brought Louis XIV to the thr. one, strict new civil regulations included mandatory. ##lighting systems. So extensive was the first ph. ase that one thousand lamplights were placed at in. ##tervals of dix toises, the equivalent of twenty ya. rds apart on Paris streets. Purportedly installe. ##d for the safety of citizens, the street lamps were. a direct result of the establishment of the for. ##ce constabulaire, the first order of French police.36. Their royal charge to recognize and name pers. ##ons in the nighttime was the true function of surveill. ance lanterns that symbolized through stark. ##radiance law and order, not beneficent illumination.

Among myriad enterprises that promulgated the mod. ##ernization of the. flame, the [r]evolution in lighting was demonstrated in unparalleled modes at the. ##Paris Expositions. Universelles of 1878, 1881, 1900, and, 1937. Over the sixty-year span of those f. ##airs, incandescent. light would sheath hundreds of pavilion façades; illuminate immense exhibition h. ##alls; punctuate even. ing skies with a brilliant glint throughout the main axes and gateways of the. ##fairgrounds, along len. gths of bridges reflected in the Seine, and, Haussmann’s grandly renovated b. ##oulevards allegedly to t. he delight of hundreds of millions.

Furthermore not only did the fairs. ##require demanding quantities of p. ower for the production of thousands of purposes, electric light. ##increased in unparalleled capacitie. s in proportion to technological expertise and socio-political. ##demands.
In 1878, the Exposition assu. med the role as a sanguine pronouncement of the country’s pro. ##pitious future following the Siege of P. aris in 1870-71.

Some thirteen million fair-goers may. have witnessed the historic illum. ##ination of the “terrific mélange of lights,” and, “great blaze of. splendor.”46 The “public provisio. ##n of the new light represented a triumph over social and cultural ‘. darkness;’ light meant lumière. ##in more than one sense, the project of the illuminated city became co. gnate with the idea of the en. ##lightened city.”47
realized through the financial and promotional effor. ts of Zenobé Gramme, invent. ##or of the direct current that was essential for Yablochkov’s success. Alt. hough Baron Haussmann had. ##utilized large-scale lumières électriques in 1854 for the reconstruction o. f the Rue de Rivoli, th. ##e lighting was restricted in a zone that presented no commercial interest. Th. e first public use of. ##his system, in October of 1877, was at the Halle Marengo of the Magasins du Lo. uvre, lit by six ar. ##c lamp lights. Two years following the triumph of the Exposition, the system grew. to 120 lamps, wit. ##h an additional 84 powered by a 100 horsepower steam engine that operated every ni. ght for two-and-. ##a-half years.

Furthermore, Jablochkoff’s illum. ##inati. on almost immediately made electric lighting practical and popular. It promised to be viable. ##in many. capacities other than the street. Edgar Degas, for example, was interested in electric ligh. ##ting ear. ly on, as noted in his letter to Felix Bracquemond about preparations for the 1879 Impress. ##ionist exh. ibition, in which he wrote, ‘La Cie Jablochkof nous propose de nous éclairer à la lumièr. ##e électrique. .’48 The passage has been annotated by the eminent Degas scholar, Theodore Reff, who h. ##as surmised, “. The new lamp.... was also used at the Salon of 1879, where it was appreciated as cas. ##ting a “truer” l. ight on the works shown, but there is no evidence that, despite Degas’s efforts, i. ##t was used at the. Impressionist exhibition of that year.” 49
News of Jablochkoff’s breakthrough was. ##reported in major. newspapers across Europe. The New York Times informed readers that, “The subject. ##of lighting streets. and houses by electricity instead of gas, or the various illuminators now in u. ##se, is exciting so mu. ch public interest that thousands of letters...are daily sent to all probable. ##centers of information. .”50 The collective thrill of the experience was interpreted by the Italian. ##novelist, Edmondo de Ami. cis, in excited verse in his Studies of Paris: “...the Avenue de l’Opéra. ##inundated with electric lig. ht; ...a crowd coming and going under a shower of rosy and whitest ligh. ##t diffused from great ground-. glass globes. ...

The undisputed. showpiece was the P. ##alais de l’Électricité. In Beaux-arts style, the colossal confection was embelli. shed with six thou. ##sand incandescent lamps and was crowned with a sculptural ensemble known as “The G. enius of Electri. ##city.” The composite group featured la Fee de l’Électricité,an electricity fairy who. se reign was p. ##opularized during her incarnation in the 1880s and 1890s as a version of France’s eter. nal maiden o. ##f Truth and Justice, Marianne.

power not only made the imposing structur. e appear as if the light was inseparable from the s. ##tructure. As if, the Deutsches Haus was in itself. a pure source of light, which in metaphoric terms. ##, the “embodiment” of light was germane to the Rei. ch’s shadowy self-stylization.
Curiously, the ef. ##fect of the brightness also created “the ghostly app. earance of a photo-negative”80 in which light. ##areas become dark, and dark are reversed to light (fig. . 29). Essentially dematerializing the colos. ##sal building’s interstices, the lighting also boosted th. e translucency of its ‘negative’ pilasters. ##, thereby adding to the nighttime electric phantasmagoria,. which the entire Exposition was committe. ##d in the appellation “la vie modern.” Yet, Speer’s structur. e was nothing other than an “expression. ##of a mobilized body politic,”81 a pastiche of trans-historic. al classicism and quasi-modernism tha. ##t pronounced the National Socialist ethos of “elective affinity. ” between Antiquity and the Third R. ##eich.82 The obscene truth of Nazi tyranny was time and again obfu. scated by lighting displays impli. ##cit in the Reich’s aesthetic, a melding of classical beauty, of the. Apollonian ethos with the Diony. ##sian notion of a revolutionary sublime, and, a violence that took fo. rm in the spirit of order and. ##the guise of discipline. The organization and deployment of electric l. ight was a silent component. ##of the aestheticized violence.

Reich’s mobilization. The indisputable affinity between the columns of li. ght in Paris. ##and those to be “switched on” in Nürnberg were unmistakable. It was purportedly the upr. ight proje. ##ction of lights on the pavilion flutes and interstices, organized in a repetition of IIIs,. interpre. ##ted as the Roman numeral “3” in reference to the Third Reich, which had inspired Speer’s id. ea for. ##the Lichtdom, the Cathedral of Light at the Nürnberg Rally. In fact, Speer’s idea was by no m. eans. ##original. In the 1930s, lighting en masse took the form of torchlight processions that were par. t o. ##f the traditional means of political propaganda. These included the march of political leaders th. r. ##ough the city and past the Hotel Deutscher Hof, the domicile of Hitler while he was in Nürnberg, wh.. ##ich was a permanent fixture of the agenda.84 Torchlight parades had long been known, including Edis. ##o. n’s in 1884 to rally support for a presidential contender; and, for the first Hollywood premieres. ##in. the early 1920s that used surplus military searchlights to announce the aura of the magic and g. ##lamo. r of movie stardom.
Gilles Deleuze noted that, “up to the end, Nazism thinks of itself in comp. ##etitio. n with Hollywood.”85 Indeed, the Reich supported the German cinema industry to try and oust. ##Hollywoo. d’s global dominance with its Jewish-run studios backed by Jewish financiers. And in so do. ##ing the Na. zis felt that they would come to dominate not only the international movie business, but. ##that the co. option of Hollywood techniques for the regime’s propaganda would work to ensure die Fü. ##hrer’s fame. A. s for Speer’s ingenuity, Wolfgang Schivelbusch matter-of-factly sets the architect’s. ##self-adulation. straight:
The light cathedral was only one of the countless light beam architecture. ##s of his epoch, b. ut doubtlessly the mightiest and most impressive. (...) What keeps the memory of. ##the Nuremberg light. cathedral so present in posterity is the context from which it arose and for wh. ##ich it had been stag. ed. Viewed

solely. as pure light architecture it was a construct like many others, but as a li. ##ght space in which 150,00. 0 people were transformed into a mass enthralled by national-socialistic. ##ideas it became a symbol fo. r the totalitarian part of the century.86
At the Reichsparteitag der Ar. ##beit, the Nürnberg “Rally of. Labor,” the high-production values, to use a cinematic term, included. ##the massive display of electri. c lights that carried the Reich’s message above all other tactics. T. ##he Führer’s salute was in inscri. bed in electric light torches “HEIL HITLER,” in concert with an en. ##ormous illuminated swastika center. ed in the Zeppelinfeld and surrounded in an assembly of one hund. ##red-and-thirty anti-aircraft Flak se. archlights of the Lichtdom (figs. 30-31). The vertical bars of. ##light, a metaphor in themselves, surr. ounded the field at twelve meters apart thereby creating an. ##enormous, imaginary common room. In tech. nical terms, the diameter of the Flak lens was 150 cm and. ##the light gave an output of 990 million ca. ndelas of intensity, the equivalent of over one billion. ##lumens that accordingly calculates as an “in. finite” throw of light (fig. 32). The collective blast. ##of light created a blazing and eerie haze tha. t could be seen from the nearby countryside. It was. ##reported that an ember of the rally lights was f. aintly visible from as far away as Chemnitz and th. ##e Danube valley, one hundred and fifty miles north. east of Nürnberg.
Flak lights, transformed for t. ##he rallies from their purpose as war machines that s. wiveled to blind enemy bombers and locate atta. ##ckers in air battles, emboldened Germany‘s fashioning. of its ascendency. The “light of the Arians,”. ##87 or cathedrals of light, was restaged in rallies from. 1936, including the Berlin Olympic Games, a. ##nd other mass gatherings

François Poncet, the French Ambas. ##sador to Germany, who had attended the Berlin Games. He summarized. much of what the Paris Expositio. ##n authorities admired most about the Reich’s steely organization and. dramaturgy: “Crowned heads, pr. ##inces, and illustrious guests thronged to Berlin, eager to meet this. prophetic being who apparently. ##held the fate of Europe in his hand, and to observe the Germany which. he had transformed and galva. ##nized in his irresistible grip.

No. t only had Hitler smirk. ##ed, ”... in such large numbers for a thing like this, other countries will th. ink we're swimming in. ##searchlights;"89 the composition was an outstanding vehicle for National Socia. list propaganda tha. ##t heralded the Lichtdom in messianic terms. “But all who are there...experience t. he holy shudder o. ##f the myth of Germany in their soul that can only be felt by German blood.”90 By 19. 39, a version o. ##f the ‘37 Lichtdom was repeated in August following the Nazi conquest of Prague.

The illumination caused by the light parachutes (. ##...) fo. llowed by the flashes from explosions, caught in the clouds of smoke from fires, countless. ##searching. floodlights, the exciting play when a plane was caught in the lights and tried to evade t. ##he cone of. light, a torch-like flash lasting seconds if it was hit: the apocalypse offered a magnif. ##icent spect. acle.”92
For all modes in which lighting was understood for its symbolic influence, it. ##was again use. d in France’s reformulation of itself, as it had been in 1878 with the Jablochkoff la. ##mps, following. the Franco-Prussian War, which had crushed the French. In 1937, the fair- project as. ##pired to rally t. he whole of France from a type of societal languor that had persisted since 1919,. ##and, to alleviate. increasing economic fragility. The reckoning of political ineffectualness, unders. ##tood by Blum’s part. y, with the lack of public displays of pomp became a common theme in the debate. ##over how French nati. onal culture could be revived. There was concern among fair officials and the. ##government as to how F. rance might compare to or compete with, or even keep pace with the mastery. ##of Nazi aesthetics at the. Exposition. The Polish-born Parisian critic, Waldemar George, who was lat. ##er proven to be a sympathi. zer of Hitler’s regime, reproached France for its lack of passion for ef. ##fective, dramatic political. festivals. In an article in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, George bawled t. ##hat National Socialism had re. connected Germany with her people’s ancient traditions and modern, cr. ##eative potential through organi. zed rallies and a “politics of force,” an unfortunate phrase of Her. ##mann Göring’s that George chose t. o quote.

Ne. vertheless, the French desire to compete with the Reich’s maste. ##ry of mass theatricality may be seen. as a version of “mimetic subversion.” Denis Hollier suggested. ##this hypothesis in his insightful anal. ysis of George Bataille’s relationship to nonconformist ideo. ##logies. With Blum’s government assigned. to the continuation of rapprochement, any aggressive move t. ##oward Germany was impossible. In Hollier’. s assessment, the “art” of mimetic subversion functions b. ##y outstripping a potential aggressor, consc. iously or unconsciously, on his own grounds, so to spea. ##k. If resistance was to be enacted by the Fre. nch in the public arena of the Exposition, what bette. ##r way than to go about it than by identificatio. n with the aggressor, Germany. Of course, the Frenc. ##h enthrallment with the Reich’s delivery of an or. dered agenda, brilliantly constructed mass rallie. ##s, uniformity in style and delivery, counter the id. ea of subversion. Yet, Hollier’s argument deepe. ##ns through the model of societal self-loathing, what. he described as the, “nausea of the Frenchman. ##on contact with himself,”93 from which mimetic subvers. ion functions in order for the victim to esc. ##ape paralysis.
The Popular Front had received sharp crit. icism for the lack of France’s display of. ##vigorous spectacle in the face of totalitarian celebration. s. Blum’s government, realizing its own. ##insecurity about the matter took bold initiatives to put lif. e back in to the fête nationale. That. ##July marked the first mass gathering in the history of the Thi. rd Republic (1870), highlighted by a. ##torchlight march of fifteen thousand light-carriers that traver. sed twelve kilometers. The light p. ##arade emulated the Reich’s powerful light processions seen by four. million people. Marcel Lods and. ##Eugene Beaudoin, lighting designers for the Exposition also designe. d the fête lights, which did no. ##t meet their satisfaction, complaining that the spectators were dispe. rsed far and wide thereby rui. ##ning any sense of unification.

model, which the. French had attempted to em. ##ulate at great expense and typical administrative, but had failed at, did. not recognize the essenti. ##al factors of proper staging and of holding the audience’s attention toward. a single focal point, t. ##hereby achieving a holistic symbol.
As the art historian Karen Fiss noted, J. acques Vienot, commiss. ##ioner of the art de fêtes, wrote an article for L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui t. hat compared photogr. ##aphs of the light parades at Nürnberg with those in Paris the summer of ‘37. Vie. not pronounced, “W. ##e must therefore revive the past for the future by reclaiming a glorious tradition. ...”94 And drawi. ##ng upon the technological and artistic resources in France, he proposed a permanent. “Academy of Joy. ##,” an organization that would assist to “bestow a new dignity on its national demonst. rations and p. ##opular festivals.”95 Vienot’s use of the word “Joy” for the effort came ominously close. to the Nazi. ##leisure organization’s, Kraft durch Freude, Strength through Joy.96
As May 25, the open. ing date o. ##f the Exposition approached, the fair became an engrossing topic in Paris despite the ongo. ing war. ##across France’s southwestern border. Upon close examination of the daily newspaper, Le Journ. al, 30. ##April 30th, one of the front page headlines read, “Guernica et un grand nombre de villages so. nt t. ##ombés aux mains des soldats de franco” (Guernica and many villages have fallen into the hands of. Fr. ##anco), with the story to follow on page three. News of the destruction of Gernika had not garnere. d. ##a full or half-page. The Gernika news piece was truncated by the illustrated advertisement, “Avant.. ##l’Exposition...tours de Lumière” (Before the Expo...Towers of Light) meant as a teaser of nighttime. ##. illumination at the Church of Saint-German-l’Auxerrois near the Louvre

Certain. ##ly the. nightlights were exhilarating. The organization of tremendous feats of incandescent programm. ##ing, in. frastructural engineering, power supply requirements, labor and financing had been consider. ##ed and dr. afted as early as 1934. Of the many challenging installations, the submersion of rotating. ##colored-sc. reen drums in watertight compartments to illuminate over two hundred fountains along th. ##e Seine was e. xceptional. The lighting systems were coordinated with pumping systems that in some c. ##ases produced s. prays up to sixty meters in height. Across the Quai d’Orsay of the Left Bank six hu. ##ndred projectors,. one hundred and fifty sodium lamps, two hundred and fifty mercury vapor lamps, an. ##d the same number. of state-of-the-art tubular lighting strands were attached to trees and imbedded. ##in bushes.

The attention paid the tower repeated an. ##old trope, but the effort was an unpreced. ented lighting installation for Paris at that time (figs.. ##35-37).

A. romanticized passage written by Paul Léon, honorar. ##y director of Beaux-Arts projects, typified the ge. neral reception of the impact of the lighting:

Electrical. power production. ##had increased in France from sixteen to twenty-one billion kilowatts over an eight-. year period fr. ##om 1930 to 1938.102 The showcasing of electricity was deemed well deserved, therefore,. lauded and f. ##inanced for the world fair.

In physical terms, the sheer. magnitude. ##of energy required to operate the pavilions and halls pushed the project to its limit.103. The prowe. ##ss of electricity was put on view in daring demonstrations that delivered a terrible and at. tractio. ##n-getting awe. Such was the anticipation of the American invented Van de Graaff generator,104. for e. ##xample, that it was featured in several popular and scientific French journals prior to its un. veil. ##ing (fig. 39).

Near the entran. ce to the Palais de l’Électricité et de la Lumière, a second demonstration. ##of raw Promethean voltage. was generated from a pair of solenoid columns that produced a bolt of li. ##ghting. The strike approxim. ated twenty-five feet in height; and, its shock of light was mirrored i. ##n a reflective pool thereby d. oubling the aura of the wild force (fig. 42). On the streamlined conv. ##ex exterior of the pavilion, He. nri Chretien’s panoramic “Hypergonar Widescreen” use of anamorphic. ##lenses projected two films to be. run concurrently in parallel horizontal registers. In keeping with. ##the pavilion’s theme of electrici. ty and light, a 6-minute cartoon, Phenômenes Électriques, and th. ##e 11-minute film, Panoramas au fil d. e l’Eau looped in regular intervals during the nighttime shows. ##(figs. 42-43).

Euripides, The Bacchae,
In early January of 1937, an influential committee of Spanis. h wr. ##iters and architects chosen to administer the construction of the Spanish Pavilion, ethnographic. an. ##d didactic exhibits, and commissions of art met with Picasso at his studio apartment on rue la Bö. e. ##tie in the 8th arrondissement. The representatives—Josep Lluís Sert, architect of the pavilion comp.. ##lex and former colleague of Le Corbusier; the poet, Juan Larrea, who served as the director of info. ##r. mation for the Spanish Embassy’s Agence Espagne; the experimental novelist and playwright, Max Au. ##b;. José Renau, Director General of the Bellas Artes, who along with the poet and playwright José Be. ##rgam. in had organized and overseen the smuggling of the collections of the Prado Museum into hiding. ##in Va. lencia during the siege of Madrid115—were unanimous in their choice of Picasso to produce a. ##signific. ant large-scale work that was without stylistic limitation, yet, would be a demonstrative. ##outcry aga. inst the slaughter of the beleaguered Republic. As a propagandistic avowal, in theory, t. ##he mural wou. ld alert fair-goers to the mortal threat of fascism in Spain, and Europe, if not the e. ##ntire world. H. owever, Picasso did nothing for over four months until the aerial bombardment of Ger. ##nika on April 26. .
115This information is outlined in Gijs van Hensbergen, Guernica: A Biography of. ##a Twentieth-Centu. ry Icon (New York and London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2004), p. 25. The committee. ##that met with Picas. so also included Sert’s architectural partner, Luis Lacasa, and three members. ##of the Alianza de Inte. lectuales Antifascistas para la Defensa de la Cultura.

Evidence of P. ##icasso’s politics was ne. ver overt. In the past, when he had expressed personal political leanings. ##in his art, they were prim. arily conveyed in an oblique manner.116 His usual hesitancy to accept co. ##mmissions that would require. of him a public political stance was suspended prior to 1936. And for. ##the bombing at Gernika117 it. has been suggested by the art historian, Gertje Utley, that the eponym. ##ous masterpiece was “motivated. less by the politics of the Spanish Civil War than by the human dram. ##a of the destruction of the Bas. que town.”118 Nevertheless, had Picasso remained hesitant to expres. ##s his personal beliefs the realit. y of the tremendous loss of life and encompassing threat of death. ##in Spain was never far from his aw. areness.
We find in the build-up to Guernica at least three key. ##works of art, several important draw. ings, and ancillary pieces that were unequivocal political ex. ##pressions of Picasso’s cri de cœur ire.. Highly articulate in symbolic attributions, instructive in. ##format, and unique style, these include,. La Dépouille du Minotaure, May 28, 1936; Rêve et Mensonge. ##de Franco I et II, January 8-9, 1937; and. , Figure de femme inspirée par la guerre d'Espagne (Portr. ##ait de la marquise de cul chrétien), Januar. y, 19, 1937 (fig. 11), and, two Baigneuse drawings from. ##February, 1937, discussed here at some lengt. h as overtly Leftist proclamations.
The French activi. ##st-playwright, Romain Rolland, requested of Pic. asso a stage curtain design for the theatrical prod. ##uction, Le 14 Juillet. The play was based within. the historical framework of the French Revolution. ##that reflected Rolland’s outcry against societal i. njustice, repression, and, war, first written an. ##d performed in 1902. Its restaging at Paris’s Théâtr. e de l'Alhambra on Quatorze Juillet of 1936 wa. ##s coordinated to celebrate the victory of the

Moreover, Rolland’s pu. ##blic theatre for social consciousness reconfirmed a decree set. in 1794 that charged poets with an o. ##bligation that their verse should celebrate, “the principal even. ts of the French Revolution...and. ##give to history that solid character which is fitting for the anna. ls of a great people who have fo. ##ught victoriously for their liberty, in spite of the opposition of a. ll the tyrants in Europe.”119. ##Picasso’s study in gouache, La Dépouille du Minotaure (fig. 1) served. as a prototype for the grand. ##stage curtain. In the context of the struggle for liberty in Spain and. the advance of fascism, the. ##allegorical work could not have belied the artist’s sympathies with the. Left despite the highly cod. ##ified nature of the small painting. The enigmatic scene was sparse yet po. tent. Realized at forty-f. ##our feet wide (fig. 2), viewers of the play saw on the stage curtain four c. haracters unlikely in a. ##ny other context than Picasso’s imagination. These were depicted within a des. olate landscape whose. ##only sign of civilization was the fragment of a war-torn building. Two of four. figures carry two o. ##thers.

Horus keeps a raptor’s ey. ##e dir. ected at the viewer. The lidless gaze is both desperate and pernicious. And given Picasso’s n. ##ear-pat. hological fear of death, the regard is apotropaic. In tandem with a screech of death emitte. ##d by Horu. s, the “sight and sound” foretells the return of wartime surveillance devices used in the. ##Great War. that would fix upon the enemy in single focus. And, the imaginary warning cry of the bir. ##dman predate. s sirens to announce enemy attacks that would soon pervade the skies of Europe. Perhap. ##s Picasso’s ho. rned, half man, half bird-of-prey was prompted by Goya’s nightmare of the monster ow. ##ls in the Los Ca. prichos etching, “The sleep of reason produces monsters,” 1799, in which the winge. ##d, menacing creatu. res personified his oneiric vision of eighteenth century Spanish society: corrup. ##ted and deserving of. ruin.
With the second duo of figures we look to the etchings of Stefano della. ##Bella, active in Pari. s in 1639-1650, and specifically to della Bella’s Death Carrying a Child, 164. ##8, from the series, The. Five Deaths, purportedly known to Picasso (fig. 3).122 If the print carries. ##symbolic and iconograph. ic imprint, it does so in several ways. “Death” lugs a large youth on his. ##back that hails to the dis. tance, perhaps in desperation to an angel beyond the framework of the sc. ##ene.

In the Picasso, the figure that would be “D. ##eath” is a sauvage man comingled with a stiffened. horse pelt. The flared nostrils and bared teeth o. ##f the horse’s skull, that seemingly express its fi. nal whinny, animate the hide, which the man peer. ##s out from under (fig. 4). A masterful rendering in. arabesque calligraphic line, the horse skin and. ##head cloak the otherwise muscular figure that carrie. s the younger man on his back. This rather Ap. ##ollonian figure wears a typical marinière, the regional. striped shirt of Bretonaise fishermen and l. ##aborers, and, favored by the “working man” Picasso himse. lf.125 In his relationship to the horse, t. ##he youth was not recast as Picasso’s pink period lad in Bo. y Leading a Horse, 1905-06; or, as a ver. ##sion of a mild radical similar to the beautiful young Parisi. an in Garçon à la pipe, from the same. ##years, who was the first to be crowned with a laurel of flower. s, a popular adornment in the gentle. ##st depictions of Marie-Thèrése Walther whose profile is cast her. e.

“O. ##h young Liberty! Bloom in my hair and flourish in my heart!” Some scholars have iden. tified the you. ##ng man as Picasso himself, and the bearded man of burden as his father, which seems pl. ausible and. ##provides a level of autobiography. Still, in this political work of art, it is Picasso’s. empathy wi. ##th the banishment of a people, of his own countrywomen, the Spanish laborer and poor wido. wer being. ##sent into uncertain futures that would harken back to the late nineteenth century through. the earl. ##y Spring of 1904 in Barcelona, represented in tenebrous scenes and portraits of the blind, t. he beg. ##gar, and the dispossessed typified in the poignant, Les pauvres au bord de la mer, 1903 (Natio. nal. ##Gallery of Art, Washington). If the Della Bella “Death” figure is paradigmatic, Picasso transfor. me. ##d the wandering specter into a warrior with the single feature of raised arm and clenched fist. Th.. ##is resolute sign insists that death will be defied in certain terms: “...to destroy those who destro. ##. y the earth.”127 Poised to throw a large stone at an unseen enemy—in the literal realm, war and th. ##e. desperation caused by it; otherwise, a macrocosmic, ubiquitous malevolence of the universe—the ma. ##n’s. duke was also a salute of Republican solidarity as a gestural polemic against the flattened pal. ##m of. “Heil Hitler.”

On January 6. ##, 193. 7, Hitler, in solidarity with Franco, declared an ultimatum that Basque citizens and the army. ##, Eusko. Gudarostea, surrender or suffer total destruction. The news catapulted Picasso into a furio. ##us state. . Two days later a cornucopia of blasphemous images spilled forth in the remarkable two-pa. ##rt etching. , Rêve et Mensonge de Franco (Dream and Lie of Franco), January 8-9, 1937 (figs. 5 and 6. ##). The narra. tive of Rêve et Mensonge reads from right-to-left in nine sequential frames. The etchi. ##ngs were compo. sed in the form of a satiric-

The Spanish Picasso scholar, Josep Pala. ##u i Fabre, summariz. ed that in “these plates we witness one of the most disturbing osmoses in the a. ##rtist’s move from a f. iercely subjective art to an art whose meaning is just as fiercely collective. ##.”128
In a merciless de. basement, a clear condemnation against Franco’s hubris and the Church that. ##supported him, Picasso ca. ricaturized the General as a polymorph that masquerades and destroys fram. ##e-to-frame. When Alfred Bar. r, Jr. was preparing his 1946 text for the exhibition, Picasso: Fifty Y. ##ears of His Art, he asked wha. t the origin of the Franco figure in the etchings was. Picasso replie. ##d: “l’étron,” the civil transla. tion meaning “a turd.” Following the “poetic” scatology of Alfred J. ##arry whom Picasso had a life-long. admiration for, the first word in Ubu Roi is “Merdre,” an obvious. ##play on “merde,” which was not lo. st on Picasso’s formulation of the Franco character.
The General. ##was made even more loathsome in the. form of a polyp, which amplified the ridicule. In marine terms. ##, a polyp is a sedentary form of the. sea urchin whose genus must have fulfilled Picasso’s darker, c. ##omic temperament since the body consis. ts of mesoglea, a gelatinous substance. The polyp has no sex. ##ual organs and thereby reproduces by bud. ding. Being sac-like the inner layers are structure-less,. ##therefore, the polyp lacks a skeletal syst. em. The fictive Franco was further sullied with the pros. ##pect that he was also a mutilated octopus; t. he etymology of polyp derived from octopus, Fr. poulpe. ##+pous.129 In the larger context of Picasso’s. oeuvre, aberrations of aquatic creatures were adapted. ##into permutations of the human body, notably t. hat of Marie-Thèrése Walther in various contortions. ##of her form

between 1931-33. Robert Rosenblum su. rmised that Picasso “goes on still further to. ##confound human anatomy with the gummy substance of ano. ther object familiar to the seashore, a squi. ##d. As the human head is transformed into an inflatable b. ulb...the vertical mouth becomes simultane. ##ously a squid’s air vent and vulva, so that finally, the w. hole figure is metamorphosed before our. ##eyes into a submarine creature obeying a primal urge.”130
Th. e aquatic life films by the French fil. ##mmaker, Jean Painlevé, a friend of the surrealist photographer. Jacques-Andre Boiffard, were engagin. ##g for many in the Parisian avant-garde, including Picasso, duri. ng the early ‘30s. As the writer Mi. ##chael Cary has shown in his recent work on the subject, Painleve’. s short films revealed a, “shocki. ##ng, balletic, combative world of drama and sex,” and in that way th. ey, “provide a visual corollary. ##to Picasso’s development in portraiture into the 1930s.”131 In the t. en-minute movie, La Pieuvre (. ##The Octopus) Painlevé filmed the creature undulating, breathing, and fi. ghting. The clip also depic. ##ted the harvesting of an octopus by a fisherman who “plucked one from a t. idal pool, wrenching the. ##creature’s head inside out, and slicing off a sticky, quivering tentacle.”1. 32 Cary further describ. ##es that Picasso would have been familiar with this treatment of the octopus h. aving grown up on the. ##Mediterranean coast where the “capture and killing of them was not only a comm. ercial practice but. ##a common rite in boyhood passage.”133
Picasso further enfeebled Franco, renderin. g his monstrous f. ##ormlessness more
extreme by adaptation of the grotesque creature in Dora Maar’s emb. lematic surreal. ##ist
photograph, Père Ubu, 1936 (fig 7). The close-up format of the “portrait” exagger. ated the
crea. ##ture’s repellant flatly pointed head, nearly invisible eyes, and tiny, menacing claws

brought forward toward the cam. era’. ##s lens for maximum effect. The image was comparable to the surrealist literary “stratégie du cho. c,. ##”134 which upended ingrained forms of expression and choices of subject. In Maar’s magnification o.. ##f the “bestial” in the earliest moments of life, she re-conceptualized the absurd, dictatorial, anti. ##. -hero, King Ubu, in Jarry’s proto- surrealist play, Ubu Roi (1896). The photograph’s intensificati. ##on. of the postured horror of “Père Ubu,” increased with Maar’s titling in that the utterly strange,. ##ne. ar-embryonic armadillo is presented as the King Father of the younger “King Ubu,” that expresse. ##s a s. ymmetry of the monstrous double. Maar’s Ubu and Picasso’s Franco inhabit realms of the same a. ##bject n. ightmare.
The essence of the Franco composite, not unlike Hans Bellmer’s Poupées, which Hal. ##Foster h. as addressed, was an assault on the, “Nazi subject with the very menace that subject fear. ##s, which is. not an attack by a figure of power but invasion [or representation by] others who, alth. ##ough identif. ied as weak, nonetheless threaten its borders...and psychically (the unconscious, sexu. ##ality, the “fe. minine.”) This fear of invasion, by one not of them, pathological in the fascist sub. ##ject, must in tu. rn be seen as a project of a fantasized bodily chaos against which that subject ar. ##mors himself, seek. ing a defense by means of a metallicized human body whose expression is...vulgar. ##ized neoclassicism.”. 135
Picasso opened to the hallucinatory in the first frame of Dream and Lie wi. ##th the heroic subject. of horse and rider. In an ironic gesture to the patrimony of Spain’s beloved. ##gentleman-hero, Don Qui. xote, whom Picasso had fondly called Señor Don Guillaume Apollinaire, in a. ##postcard to his friend in. 1907, the Franco-polyp character also sits astride his horse under the Sp. ##anish sun (figs. 8 and 9)..

Although the suffering hack w. ##as reconstituted from its earliest ap. pearance in sketches of the corrida made during Picasso’s ret. ##urn to Spain in the early summer of 191. 7, the heinous grin in ‘36 overstated the absurdity of the. ##horse.

As the legend went and Picasso transformed, Bellerophon-Franc. o fell off Pegasus and did n. ##ot make it to the mountain. Franco must then complete his destructive co. urse riding a pig, which i. ##n some folk beliefs were only ridden by witches.140
Picasso reifies the so. rdidness of scene nine w. ##ith the horse and rider, now pig and l’etron-polyp points a spear directly a. t the sun (fig. 10). F. ##ranco grins more widely than before as if his ridiculous attempt to diminish t. he light by hubris w. ##ere possible. Not only does the scene contain a black sun, the sun of the Apocal. ypse and the inver. ##sion of Good; Picasso proposed the death of the sun in terms different than the 19. 33 series, Morte. ##au Soleil, and other campaigns in which it was under threat in the early ‘30s, in t. hat it had acq. ##uired scatological characteristics in the etching. Bataille’s heterodox essay, “The So. lar Anus” (1. ##927) may have had no bearing on Picasso in the Franco depiction of frame nine, unlike th. e importan. ##ce of “The Rotten Sun” had had for Crucifixion in 1930, or that the painting had had on th. e essay,. ##as it were. However, Allan Stoekl, Bataille’s translator, summarized that by ‘27 he was, “a. lready. ##developing an approach to what he would call later, in among other essays, ‘The Psychological.

That is, matter that was so repulsive that it resisted. not. ##only the idealism of Christianity, Hegel, and the surrealists, but even the conceptual edifice-. bu. ##ilding traditional materialists.

In early February, Picasso drew six “Cabana” scenes, the last of a se. ##ries of exceedingly symbolic a. utobiographical works begun in 1927, in which a singular aberrant fi. ##guration of Franco on the beach. culminated the Rêve et Mensonge campaign.161 In two of the dystopic. ##sheets a black sun illuminates F. ranco in Baigneuse, and equally, Baigneuse sous Soleil Noir, Febr. ##uary 9, 1937 (figs. 14 and 15).

The small sketch was a “fir. ##st thought” and served as a model for the more harrowing and fin. ished sheet, Bather in Black Sun,. ##in which Franco is further articulated with a composite of tumorou. s bulges, multiple orifices, fli. ##pper-like arms, and a lower torso with columnar legs so architectura. l that the figure, one of Pica. ##sso’s most terrifying symbols of brutality and darkness, appears to be. sunk into the sand, immobile. ##yet jumping rope.

On the afternoon of A. pril 27, 1937, in an intensely. ##distressed atmosphere, an anti- fascist demonstration that included F. rench and Spanish intellectua. ##ls, writers, and artists marched on the main boulevards of Paris. Franc. oist atrocities were known. ##and had been escalating. The Paracuellos Massacres in November and Decemb. er of ‘36 were an onslaug. ##ht by Nationalist forces against hypothetical allies of a proletariat coup.. Over two thousand peopl. ##e, mostly anti-Nationalist military, Spanish intellectuals, and Catholic pri. ests were taken hostag. ##e. Notwithstanding assurances of their release they were hoarded into buses an. d driven to the outs. ##kirts of Madrid, to Paracuellos del Jarama and Torrejon de Ardoz and executed.

War and thereafter what would become World War II.
With the Insurgent capture of Irún on September. ##. 3, and, coastal San Sebastián, on September 13, 1936, Franco had cut the Basques off from their Fr. ##en. ch border and a large part of their native territory. The seizure also gave the Nationalists con. ##trol. of one thousand square miles of Vizcayan country that included many of northern Spain’s most i. ##mport. ant factories. By late March of ‘37, attacks on Madrid were halted in order to focus military. ##intens. ification on the northern Republic held zone. There, the cinturón del hierro, a network of. ##fortifica. tions was planned to completely surround Bilbao, Franco’s primary target, along with its. ##nearest out. lying villages and countryside. The idea included laying two hundred kilometers of barb. ##ed wire, tren. ches, and machine gun bunkers that would require fifteen thousand workers, engineers,. ##construction s. pecialists, and architects to build the line. Ingeniously planned and similar to ot. ##her rigid fortifi. cations, the cinturón, or “Belt of Iron” had lulled the Basques into a false sens. ##e of security. Huge. gaps in the line were left unfinished; camouflage and defenses against aerial a. ##ttacks went unconsid. ered; and, the essential principle of fortification, the depth of the defense,. ##would require multipl. e trench lines from which troops could emerge and retreat that ultimately, t. ##ragically went un-built.. The Spanish Nationalist offensive on March 31, commanded by General Emilio. ##Mola, led directly to th. e bombing of Durango. Mola bellowed the threat, "I have decided to termin. ##ate rapidly the war in the. north: those not guilty of assassinations and who surrender
of a burial. ##plot." More than a half of t. he victims of the Nationalist repression in Badajoz were landless peas. ##ants and journeymen. Helen Gra. ham, The Spanish Civil War: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford and Lo. ##ndon: Oxford University Press, 2. 005), p. 32.

Gernika (transl. ##iterated from the ancestral Basque dialect, Euzkar. a, to Guernica) lies 36 kilometers from Bilbao a. ##nd fewer by plane. By late afternoon of April 16, 19. 37, the town lay smoldering in ruins and carpe. ##ted with carnage.180 Operation Rügen, a component of U. nternehmen Feuerzauber, or, Operation Magic. ##Fire, was commanded from Germany by Nazi Reichsmarschall. Göring, and masterminded by Colonel Wolfra. ##m von Richthofen, who would come to organize the murderou. s blitzkriegs on Poland and France.

Lumo, as the sacred town is known in Spain, was us. ed as an alibi to conduct an all. ##-out aerial attack. According to Göring’s sworn testimony nine years. later during the Nuremberg Tri. ##als, he claimed, “The Führer thought the matter over. I urged him to. give support under all circums. ##tances [and] to test my young Luftwaffe at this opportunity in this or. that technical respect. With. ##the permission of the Führer, I sent a large part of my transport flee. t and a number of experimen. ##tal fighter units, bombers, and antiaircraft guns; and in that way I had. an opportunity to ascertai. ##n, under combat conditions, whether the material was equal to the task.”18. 1 Göring’s false claim o. ##f “combat conditions” attempted to justify the attack piloted by inexperienc. ed crews. The operatio. ##n was nothing less than an egregious laboratory trial that used the town and i. ts people for the Na. ##zi experiment.
The Luftwaffe fleet included twenty-three large Junker JU52 tri-m. otor planes conver. ##ted from transporters to bombers; an uncounted number of the harrowing JU87 Stuka. dive bombers; fou. ##r swift Heinkel He-III medium bombers that had been built in violation of the Treat. y of Versailles. ##in the early ‘30s; ten Heinkel He5I fighter-bombers; three Savoia-Marchetti SM81 Pip. istrello bomb. ##er-transport planes that featured long-range visibility; the Dornier Do17 light bomber,. known as th. ##e Fliegender Bleistift, or "flying pencil;" twelve Fiat CR32 fighter bi-planes; and, fro. m the asse. ##mbly line in Regensburg, new Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters. The planes streamed into Gernik. a-Lumo i. ##n a formation of three abreast, and indiscriminately dropped 250 kg “splinter” bombs and ECB. 1 ther. ##mite incendiary bombs which, burning at 2500o centigrade upon explosion, disintegrated two- th. irds. ##of the town into a carbonized ruin (figs. 22-24).

front, especially in bombing villages...these t. ##a. rgets are easy to find and can be thoroughly destroyed by carpet bombing.”182 As it was, the tonn. ##age. dropped on Gernika-Lumo was so top-heavy that the Spanish author, César Vidal, deduced, "If the. ##aer. ial attacks had stopped at that moment, for a town that until then had maintained its distance. ##from. the convulsions of war, it would have been a totally disproportionate and insufferable punish. ##ment.”1. 83
The Basque President, José Antonio de Aguirre, made an official announcement on Radio Bi. ##lbao184 o. n April 27, telling the world of an atrocity that had happened the previous twenty-four h. ##ours. The f. aint transmission reached as far as Paris and banished all rumors in lieu of first-hand. ##newspaper re. ports:
German airmen in the service of the Spanish rebels have bombarded Gernika, bur. ##ning the histor. ic town that is held in such veneration by all Basques. They have sought to wound u. ##s in the most sen. sitive of our patriotic sentiments, once more making it entirely clear what Euzka. ##di may expect of th. ose who do not hesitate to destroy us down to the very sanctuary that records t. ##he centuries of our l. iberty and democracy.
In Paris, confusion and disbelief set in.185 Pro-Franco. ##stories began to circu. late accusing the “Reds” of obliterating their own people. Radio Nacional i. ##n Salamanca denied Nation. alist involvement. And along with those reports others expressed the “gre. ##at success” by the Luftwaff. e that had been quickly dispersed throughout Spain. The real and truthf. ##ul accounts of the human suff. ering were first recorded, wired, and published in English.

Corman, Noel Monks, and Chri. ##stopher Holme, their eyewitness accounts did no. t betray the facts. The four were the only reporter. ##s stationed in Bilbao. They were notified a few h. ours after the bombing had ceased. Arriving in Ge. ##rnika at 11:00 PM they heard lingering cries of the. injured and watched helplessly as Gudaris, the. ##Basque soldiers, frantically struggled to dig bodies. from the smoldering debris. Steer remained unt. ##il the early morning of the 27th interviewing victims. and helping as he could, which he later claim. ##ed was his authority for all that that he have written. . His renowned report, ‘The Most Appalling A. ##ir Raid Ever Known,’187 was published at length in The T. imes of London and The New York Times :
... ##.when I visited the town the whole of it was a horrible si. ght, flaming
from end to end. The reflec. ##tion of the flames could be seen in the clouds
of smoke abov. e the mountains from ten miles away. T. ##hroughout the night houses were falling until the streets beca. me long heaps of red impenetrable de. ##bris. ...survivors were evacuated in Government lorries, but man. y were forced to remain round the. ##burning town lying on mattresses or looking
for lost relatives and. children.... In the form of its. ##execution and the scale of the destruction it wrought, no less than. in the selection of its objecti. ##ve, the raid on Guernica is unparalleled in military history.... The. object of the bombardment was. ##seemingly the demoralization of the civilian population and the destr. uction of the cradle of the B. ##asque race. Every fact bears out this appreciation....188

Picasso was informed of the attack by Juan Larrea who had rushed to find him in the vicini. ##ty of th. e Café de Flore after hearing the news from the Basque artist, José María Ucelay, in a cha. ##nce encoun. ter at the Metro Champs-Elysée.190 It is known that Picasso read Steer’s vital account i. ##n the April. 28th edition of L’Humanité that blasted the headlines, ‘Mille bombes incendiaries lancé. ##es par les av. ions de Hitler et de Mussolini’ (One thousand incendiary bombs launched by the planes. ##of Hitler and.

Visitors to the mark. et are calculated at 3,000. ...at half past four, the first squadr. ##ons appeared, dropping grenades. T. he population fled toward the fields, pursued by fighters with m. ##achine guns. Further squadrons of tr. i-motors dropped hundreds of bombs, many of which weighed 1000. ##kilos, opening deep craters. The bomb. ardment continued with medium-sized bombs. A thousand were c. ##ounted. Finally, the terrified town was. deluged by a rain of incendiary bombs, the number of which. ##is estimated at 3,000. The bombing and st. rafing by fighter planes ceased at a quarter to eight. I. ##go to the place by car. The scenes of horro. r that I witnessed defy the imagination. The city was n. ##othing but an immense brazier, hurling gigant. ic flames toward the sky.... No kind of intervention. ##was possible on account of the heat. The scream. s of the women and children caused us terrible angu. ##ish.191
Larrea had sensed that the bombardment of. Gernika might be the subject for Picasso’s mural,. ##later confirmed by Andre Malraux,192 and Roland P. enrose who wrote that the bombings had produced. ##a “gratuitous outrage...[and had] roused Picasso fro. m melancholy to anger. Acting as a catalyst to. ##the anxiety and indignation mingled within him, the t. ragedy had given him the theme perhaps unkno. ##wingly what he had been seeking.”193 The senseless oblit. eration proved to be the tipping point, a. ##causa proxima from which Picasso’s inertia about the Spani. sh Pavilion project turned to fury.194 U. ##ntil then, his seeming
191 Other reports in the news dailies. included the Parisian, Le Petit Journa. ##l, that described, “Three young girls and their mother paint. for us a picture of their terror durin. ##g the three-hour-long bombardment, the collapse and burning of. their dwelling, and then their bewil. ##dered flight along the road to Bilbao while the German airplane. s fired at them with machine guns.”. ##And in another account, "The crowds of refugees who blocked the. road out of Málaga had been in an. ##inferno. They were shelled from the sea, bombed from the air and t. hen machine-gunned. The scale of. ##the repression inside the fallen city explained why they were ready. to run the gauntlet."

disinterest in it had lasted since late January shortly afte. r the agreement had. ##been struck. The causes for his disinclination to begin the project seem varied. and have been wide. ##ly discussed in the literature on the subject. As it was, the lack of dialogue wit. h his closest fr. ##iends, evidence of meaningful sketches, or semi-realized plans had been confounding. for the committ. ##ee who feared that the centerpiece of the pavilion’s lobby might not be created. When. measured agai. ##nst the ever-increasing incidents of bombings and executions in Spain; and, true anxie. ty about his. ##family who had survived the bloody combats of ’36 in Barcelona that resulted in over fi. ve hundred. ##deaths, even those events had not been reason enough to galvanize Picasso into action in. the studi. ##o.
A passage in Christian Zervos’s catalogue raisonné, Pablo Picasso, offers an enlightenin. g theor. ##y on the artist’s conflicted political disposition, which may elucidate, in part, the barren. period. ##before the bombing at Gernika became topical. Zervos wrote, “For a long time, Picasso wondere. d if. ##he should pay attention to events in Spain.... he reacted against his feelings, even against th. e. ##strongest urgings of his spirit, for a long time he had to defend himself against his own heart, t.. ##o preserve what is unique in man and avoid the trap of the passions.”195 This was magnified in the s. ##. tory of Picasso’s father, José Ruiz Blasco on his deathbed in May of 1913, who uttered his last wo. ##rd. s to his son, a squib repeated throughout his childhood: "What have things come to? Are there no. ##mor. e frontiers?"196 As John Richardson recorded from family lore, Picasso, "concealed his grief s. ##o succ. essfully that he was criticized for being unfeeling; he was however, as Eva Gouel his paramo. ##ur [in t. hose years] reported, ‘stricken.’”197 Sublimation was a general characteristic of male And. ##alusian be. havior, where formalidad, or civility, with its emphasis on self-restraint and self-cont. ##rol, was

especially necessary in a culture that. ##devalued toughne. ss and bravado. Control was everything. And due to this mindset, Picasso was given. ##to evasion, there. by in his art to the play of inversion and sublimation.
Penrose had used the wor. ##d, “melancholy,” to. describe Picasso’s mental state at the time, which may be pondered through Juli. ##a Kristeva’s work in. Black Sun, Depression and Melancholia. “Melancholic persons, with their despon. ##dent, secret insides,”. she wrote, “are potential exiles but also intellectuals capable of dazzling,. ##albeit abstract, const. ructions”198 In the chapter, “Sadness Holds Back Hatred,” Kristeva further. ##clarified that, ”When the. struggle between imaginary creation and depression is carried out precise. ##ly on that frontier of the. symbolic and the biological, we see indeed that the narrative or the arg. ##ument is ruled by primary p. rocesses. Rhythms, alliterations, condensations shape the transmission. ##of message and data.”199 Freu. d’s renowned and foundational essay, “Mourning and Melancholia” (1915. ##), separated the two psychologi. cal states such that “object-loss” defines the melancholic lost to. ##herself, and therefore, is withdr. awn from consciousness. For the mourner, simply stated, this is o. ##ne who has lost a beloved or homela. nd, or is that person who is left behind after a disaster. In F. ##reud’s work on the problem of Trauer,. he summarized, “In mourning it is the world which has become. ##poor and empty....”200

Accordingly,. ##the survivor “works through” the anguish and e. merges (in whatever form that may take) as a sorrow. ##ful person, but not a self-tortured one.201
In Pi. casso’s first political statement made in May of. ##‘37 he disclosed, “In the panel on which I am worki. ng which I shall call Guernica, and in all my r. ##ecent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence o. f the military caste which has sunk Spain in. ##an ocean of pain and death....”202 As revealed in an in. terview in the 1960s, he claimed, “that dea. ##th could fall from heaven on so many, right in the middle. of rushed life, has always had a great me. ##aning for me.”203 From which Gasman, concluded that, “deat. h from the sky” affirmed the artist’s “f. ##ear of air raids he confessed to only in his writings was ev. idently a fear for the plight of other. ##human beings.”204 If anchorage in the empirical was a predict. able aspect of the general rule gove. ##rning his oeuvre; his conception of the universe between 1936 wh. en the war in Spain fully erupted. ##and France fell to Nazi Germany in 1940, was rooted in one particu. lar aspect of his engagement wit. ##h the world: a disrupting empathy with the victims of the terror bom. bings that distinguished the S. ##panish Civil War and World War II from all earlier military events.

La. ##rrea: “What does a bombing look like?”205 The problem, at that early date in the evoluti. on of his. ##thinking pointed to the very impossibility of representing atrocity, and certainly discoun. ting any. ##recourse to mimesis, of bringing that which was un-seeable into the light, of that which wa. s unkn. ##owable to the future viewers of his painting into a visibility in conceptual and symbolic term. s. G. ##oya, on the other hand, whom Picasso must have kept in the back of his mind knowing well the mas. te. ##r’s Disastros de la Guerra (1810-1820) had put himself into the reality of his depictions of war,. i. ##nto that carnage and desecration of the human being by atrocities of the Spanish and French alike d.. ##uring the Peninsular War (1807- 1814) campaign in the Napoleonic Wars. Contrary to Picasso’s strate. ##g. y of distancing through allegory in Guernica, we see Goya himself through the titling of the etch. ##ing. s: “One Can’t Look” (plate 26), “I Saw It” (plate 44), “This is How it Happened” (plate 47), “I. ##t’s N. o Use Crying Out” (plate 58), and, “What Madness!” (plate 68), among the sweep of 80 exceptio. ##nally b. old images.
Utilizing Jan Provost’s immaculately painted, Sacred Allegory, 1470-1529, refer. ##red to in. order to broaden our consideration of Picasso’s conundrum, Derrida proffered that, "whate. ##ver its sy. mbolic over-determination, [the painting] must always be contemplated as the representat. ##ion or refle. ction of its own possibility.

With Picasso’s version—and here we note that. the filament was uniquely shaped in other li. ##ght bulbs in his oeuvre, ca. 1914-34—the tungsten wire w. as both symbolic of something other than i. ##ts properties as a conductor of energy, and simultaneously. just that, a conduit for the sun’s abili. ##ty to illuminate the sun below it.

An aerial map of the Condor Legion’s bombardment plan was. published on the front pages of L. ##’Humanité, Le Matin, and Le Petit Journal on April 28 and 29 (fig.. 29).

“fi. lament. ##-Harlequin”211 from 1914, discussed in Chapter 4: “The Electric Avant-Garde,” was modified for. the. ##stylization of the electric sun in 1937, it was correspondingly a cipher of tragedy as it had b. een. ##at the advent of the Great War.
The magnitude of Guernica resides in the distinctive realms of t. h. ##e visual and the aural. If the deafening sirens of the Nazi Luftwaffe Condor Legion’s JU 87 Stuka p.. ##recision dive-bomber planes that attacked Gernika, and the horrors of other bomber planes and aeria. ##l. strafing that struck dirt, stone, and flesh prompted Picasso’s figuration of screaming heads,212. ##th. e reality of the Stuka’s high-pitched shrill of the “Jericho-Trumpet” to terrorize, was total. A. ##har. rowing and deafening shriek was let loose when the plane descended at a 60- 90o dive with spee. ##ds up. to 350 mph. According to Dr. Heinz Migeod, a WWII Stuka pilot, “...when the diver bomber come. ##s down. on you as such, as I once experienced, it is awful”.... and intended to be “psychologically. ##overwhel. ming.”213 Despite the fact that Luis Buñuel’s ground-breaking documentary, Land Without Br. ##ead (1933). was not shown at the Spanish Pavilion in Paris, I find that a resonance between it and P. ##icasso’s in. tention in Guernica are closely related, the film, “...certainly owes to the power of t. ##he gaze...a t. horough misery to the bone, to a light whose cruelty...aims to shake up a satiated pu. ##blic, but even. 211 Author’s term, 2015.
212 Picasso’s campaign of open-mouthed heads is seen in the. ##surrealistic ma. ndibular works from 1928- 1931. The extreme expressions of lamentation, pain, or g. ##rief from the 1930. s is especially powerful in the depiction of Christ in Picasso’s series, Crucifi. ##xion, September 17-1. 9, 1932, a redux of the central panel of Mathias Grünewald’s Isenheim Alterpie. ##ce. A series of viciou. s entanglements of horse and bull in the corrida from August and September o. ##f 1934, also demonstrate. the vicious heads. The premonitory drawing, Femme devant une fenêtre, Spri. ##ng, 1937, is closest in m. orphology to the three upturned heads in Guernica, 1937 and in preliminar. ##y studies of his obsession. with teeth and jaws.
213 The “Jericho-Trumpet” was ordered by Adolf Hitl. ##er in 1935 and first put to. use in the aerial bombardment of Gernika. Quote from interview with the. ##92 year-old Heinz Migeod, “D. iving Sirens of the JU-87,” found at www.heinzmigeod.com.

In effect, the spotlighting on the closely groupe. ##d pedestals of bust. s and standing figures delineated the sculptural forms by extreme shadowing upo. ##n the volumes and sur. faces. It also made of the busts powerful silhouettes, in white plaster, whos. ##e opacity finds equival. ence, in painterly terms, in the white stamped out silhouettes in Guernica.. ##Brassaï’s atelier scene. is punctuated in deep flat blacks and gradient shadows caused from the oil. ##lamp.222 But the point to. be made is one of correspondence between the effect of strong lighting i. ##n the photograph and that i. n Guernica. Picasso had stayed with the theme of L’Atelier for the pavi. ##lion mural before the bombard. ment at Gernika changed everything. Yet if Guernica retained certain. ##aspects of the studio leitmotif. , which it did, especially in studies of Marie-Thèrése and the cons. ##truction of an interior complete. with walls and tiled floor, the impact of Brassaï’s photographs ma. ##y have been a compelling model for.

In particular ways, the dramatic lighting of the comp. ##act Boisgeloup group may have easily tr. anslated to the dramatic lighting of a similarly tight conf. ##iguration of characters in the painting..

figures are self-contained, meaning. ##in close proximity to one another in the claustrop. hobic setting, but they do not touch as we also. ##find in the arrangement of the busts of Marie- There. se and other works in progress in the studio.. ##And in this way, the strong illumination of the scene. supplied from an imaginary source beyond the. ##scope of the internal workings of the picture, gave pre. cedent and importance to each of the figure. ##s. In other words, there are several sources of light, al. beit levels of truth as light must be, wo. ##rking simultaneously: an invisible light; an electric sun;. and, a candle.
T. J. Clark quoting Malra. ##ux who quoted Picasso who spoke of the light in Goya’s Third. of May shortly after the completion of. ##Guernica in June of ’37:
[It] is not a sky, it is just black. ness. The light takes two forms. One. ##of which we do not understand. It bathes everything, like moonl. ight...But it is much brighter than. ##the moon. And then there is the enormous lantern on the ground,. in the center. That lantern, what. ##does it illuminate? The fellow with upraised arms, the martyr. Loo. k carefully: its light falls onl. ##y on him. The lantern is Death. Why? We don’t know. Nor did Goya. Bu. t Goya, he knew it had to be l. ##ike that.223
It is valuable to recognize the configuration of brightne. ss from the sun’s graphic di. ##agonal throw distributed in segments of the field. Light is most apparen. t as it cuts across the ri. ##ght hand half of the picture, from the top point of the internal compositi. on of the picture, that. ##of a classic solid pyramidal design. The hard radiance passes over the forea. rm of the candle beare. ##r and through the upward-turned left eye of the crouching or fleeing woman. It. then slices through. ##her figure and virtually cuts the body in two, finishing in an obtuse corner tr. iangle fashioned as. ##the hem of her apron or frock (fig. 33). The triangle is faintly apparent to the. spectator’s left,. ##laid as it is into blackness. It hits behind the horse and terminates in a small. grey right triang. ##le. The tip points to the taper of an impressive enmorillada, or tossing muscle of. the bull’s neck,. ##which is one piece with its formidable head 223 Clark, op. cit., p. 248.
127
 127. crowned by a pro. ##truding testuz, the bull’s forehead, and intimidating corniapretados, small, curved. horns.224 The b. ##ottom edge of the triangle then cuts back sharply toward the horse. Black space empha. sizes the agi. ##tated white tail that flails like the hair of the crying woman with baby, as a rabilarg. o, or long-. ##tailed bull that may also be characterized as a gañafon, slang for a bull that looks good. , but wit. ##h evil intentions.
Still, as if to distinguish the personal and deeply symbolic nature of t. he anim. ##als, in contrast to the human figures, the horse and bull are semi-transparent lacking in the. concr. ##eteness of the man, women, and child. Picasso’s work on the bull is exemplary. The layering of. the. ##white head reveals over-painting in thin lead white on graphite or black oil paint that left be. hin. ##d a ghostly third eye hovering at the center of the broad, flat shape (fig. 34). The head also in. c. ##ludes the artifacts of drawing a swirling tail, which was repositioned from left to right. Of prima.. ##ry importance, the esoteric eye, the parietal eye that not only serves to regulate circadian rhythm. ##s. and to sense the polarization of light, was correlative to Bataille’s inversion of the pineal eye. ##t. hat submits to the death drive. Bataille spoke of, “The eye, at the summit of the skull”225 that. ##ope. ns onto an “incandescent sun”226 whose radiance allows vision to be contemplated in a “siniste. ##r soli. tude.”227 From his essay, “The Pineal Eye,” we read: “...the head, instead of locking up lif. ##e as mon. ey is locked in a safe, spends it without counting, for at the end of this erotic metamorp. ##hosis, the. head has received the electric power of points. This great burning head is the image of. ##the disagre. eable light of the notion of expenditure.... From the first, myth is identified not onl. ##y with life b. ut with the loss of life–with degradation and death.... Existence no longer resembles. ##a neatly defin. ed
224 These physical characteristics find close resemblance to the bull in, Minota. ##ure, September, 1. 933, charcoal on paper, 51 x 34 cm., coll. Musée Picasso, Paris.

itinerary from o. ##ne practical sign to. another, but a sickly incandescence....”228
The horse exhibits equally ominous. ##traits of death. Wher. eas the diaphanous head of
the bull is specter-like, that of the horse is di. ##agrammatic and composed. of solid parts. As if Picasso applied the science of x-radiography to the h. ##ead, he exposed the shock. ing and horrifying image of an incendiary bomb lodged into the horse-skul. ##l (figs. 35-37). Its cry, f. ar louder than those of the women is explainable by this image of insta. ##nt death. The near- exact cyl. indrical form of the bomba incendiaria dropped by Heinkel HE-111 bomb. ##ers at Gernika fills the entire. ty of the horse’s mouth cavity; the tapered detonator serves as the. ##tongue. Very little has been wri. tten about the weapons released from the Luftwaffe’s Heinkel, acc. ##ording to a Spanish monograph on th. e subject that claims it is a “fundamentally arid topic.”229 Ne. ##vertheless and in disputation to that. opinion, Picasso would have read about the incendiary bombs d. ##ropped at Gernika from Steer’s report. in L’Humanité. In his quest to understand what a “bombing loo. ##ks like,” he generalized the incendiary. device in a great likeness. The startling reality of the we. ##apon, a facsimile of terror now located. within the body of the already suffering horse, whose stunn. ##ed and lidless eyes express absolute terr. or, here then, the horse as signifier of the Spanish peop. ##le, is nearly unbearable.
As we return to s. crutinize the sun it becomes evident that it casts its. ##own black shadow, in reverse, so to defy the. natural law of shadows in which an object casts a long. ##or short contour depending upon the time of d. ay and the position of radiance upon it (fig. 38). B. ##lack-rays emanate from behind the solid sun-shap. e as if it was a template cut from the background. ##“screen” of the setting. Most importantly, the cas. t shadow of the electric sun was caused by a sou. ##rce of radiance brighter than the sun itself and bey. ond of it. If one

concedes that the ground of the p. ##icture plane is correspondent with the “ground,” as Ernst. Gombrich describes, we understand that th. ##e “shadow cast by an object on the ground on which it rests. immediately enhances the impression of. ##its solidity.”230
Gombrich’s commentary on light and shadows. , on the principles of these virtues o. ##f the sense of sight first delineated in Leonardo’s systematic. series of propositions in Treatise o. ##f Painting, noted that, “Not only the shape but the outer limit. s of the shadows and their color ca. ##n convey to us the character of the illuminating light.”231 In Da. vid Summers Judgment of Sense, he. ##quoted the master who instructed,“...use your ingegno to set the b. odies against backgrounds [in c. ##ampi] so that the part of those bodies which is dark ends on a bright. ground, and the illuminated p. ##art of the body terminates in a dark ground.”232 Further surmising tha. t tonal painting, which Leon. ##ardo set forth by chiaroscuro, was an “infinitely flexible binary system. that underlay a capacity f. ##or illusion and fiction that was also infinite....”233 the broad adjustme. nts to the behaviors of l. ##ight, its quantity and quality and the objects contained within those effec. ts were excised by Pica. ##sso. First in cubism, and thereafter from one who “rejects all the sweet geom. etry”234 that holds t. ##he world together. In his caustic voice of the war years, he touted in a diary. entry, “...if we tra. ##ce a line from A to C and K to F bypassing X and Y and subdividing D x H it’s ju. st the same what a. ##parrot has so let them give it all to me I’ve seen it all a thousand times and mo. re I’ve got it c. ##linched because it’s necessary to believe in mathematics and art is really something. else....”235

Light Becoming Avant-Garde
Part 1: A Short History of El. ##ectric Light in Early Moder. nism
I knew there could be light not moon-light star-light day-light an. ##d candle light,
I knew I knew. I saw the lightening light, I saw it light, I said
I I I must have th. ##e light, and what did I do oh. what did I too I said I would sell my soul
all through but I knew I k. ##new that electric light was all. true, and true oh yes, it is true...
“Doctor Faustus Lights the Lig. ##ht” Gertrude Stein
Approximately. fifty years before electricity had made an impact on burgeoning mo. ##dernity in the long nineteenth ce. ntury,236 Goethe asserted in his treatise on weather, Versuch ein. ##er Witterungslehre (1825), “Electri. city is the pervading element that accompanies all material exi. ##stence even the atmospheric. It is to. be thought of as the soul of the world.”237 If electricity wa. ##s thought of in terms of pneuma, or vi. tal “spirit,” considered in the Renaissance terms of pneumat. ##ic physiology, which was, according to D. avid Summers, “fundamental to the most basic and pervasive. ##religious and cultural values. The depict. ion of movement was of the very highest importance for t. ##he art of painting...[it] made the movements. of the soul apparent. That is...all living matter was. ##‘animated,’ literally ‘inspired” or ensouled.. ...” 238 Goethe’s equation of the electric with the s. ##oul apportioned the energy from its scientific. parameters and empiricist framework to the realms of. ##imagination

In a reflection of the tra. dition of pneuma expressed by Aristo. ##tle,239 Summers further elucidated that the transitive motion gi. ves rise or prompts us to, “see in. ##dreams, in our own light, or in the light of our own phosphoresce. nt spirit.” 240 In that electric. ##ity would so inspire a fantastic production of literary and visual a. rts, as early as 1819 in Mary. ##Shelley’s masterpiece of fiction, Frankenstein (1819), we find that th. e subtle emanations of the s. ##ilent, embodied energy became a vital constituent in the formation of ma. ny vanguard canons.
The se. ##nse that electric current was a living thing, like the innate life force o. f plants, animals, human. ##beings, and, as invisible as air and odorless as pure water it became non-d. istinct from other for. ##ms of organic life in specific praxes of art and literature.
The pivotal shift. in which the science. ##of electricity acquired a subjective-poetic voice coincided with the point at. which the mystery of. ##its agency was conveyed through utopian rhetoric and applied anthropomorphism.. Shelley’s Frankenst. ##ein, whose little known subtitle, The Modern Prometheus—a coinage by Immanuel Kan. t in deference to. ##Benjamin Franklin’s groundbreaking work with electricity—was inspired, in part, by. galvanism, the. ##precursor of the science of electrophysiology.

The emanation in Sonia Del. ##aunay’s Electric Prisms, 1914, for example, was on. e of hundreds of small, numbered drawings that m. ##ade in pastel, watercolor, and gouache devoted to th. e theme of prismatic light (fig. 1). Delaunay. ##claimed to, “like electricity. Public lighting was a n. ovelty. At night during our walk we entered. ##the era of light, arm-in-arm.”243 The Electric Prisms (f. ig. 2) may also be seen as a chromatic man. ##ifesto of purpose, for the interpenetrating planes of colo. r, the aura of solar and planetary bodie. ##s represented by concentric prismatic orbs, and the concurre. nce of solidity, translucency and diss. ##olution are elements identifiable with much of Sonia Delaunay’. s work and with her fundamental conc. ##eption of rhythm, “...based on numbers because color can be meas. ured by its vibrations.”244 In thi. ##s sense she would be referring to the color of electric lamp light. s on the Boulevard St. Michel in. ##Paris where she often strolled with her husband, Robert Delaunay, i. n years leading up to the Grea. ##t War.245
The diversity of the works sketched out in this brief analys. is possess the hallmark of v. ##arying manners of abstraction and allegory formulated from visionary con. cepts of mythical electric. ##ity’s symbolic essence and by sheer observation and study of the new light. in its spectral capaciti. ##es. All this in turn fostered futuristic, erotic, revolutionary utopian, pu. rely abstract, and anti. ##-war works of art that were the knell of new social conditions, therefore ant. idotal to the cultura. ##l hegemony of Romanticism and its adherents. As an eventual consequence of the. vanguard’s invective. ##against the past the very agency of the electric, inseparable from the aestheti. cs of the machine. ##was exalted with dedication and genius.

Certainly, Ru. ssian F. ##uturism had been imprinted with certain aspects of the utopian ethos of Italian Futurism.

Electricity, thousand dazzling violet arms of Electricity.”249 His vision in “The Electric Wa. ##r”250. was that of a golden age of electricity and his envy of “the men who will be born a century l. ##ater.... ” in “beautiful Italy which will have come completely under the control of electric forces.. ##...”251

The painting n. ##ot only attempted to represent the then c. urrent theories on the diffusion of light, it was unprece. ##dented in its singling out and celebration. of the explosive energy of electric light as the sole su. ##bject in a work of art. Composed of vibratin. g lines and small dashes of color, in deference to the. ##systematic color theories of George Seurat an. d Paul Signac whom Balla studied,252 the light antic. ##ipates the fractured machine light of the Futuri. st program. Signac’s comments on Eugène Delacroix’. ##s murals in the Chapelle des Sainte-Anges in Saint. -Sulpice provide a fine perspective on the rende. ##ring of light in Street Lamp. In accord with Seurat’. s notes and their mutual research, Signac wrot. ##e in the essay, D’Eugène Delacroix au néo-impressionis. me (1899), “...he no longer painted with any. ##but the most simple and pure colors.... There is not a. single fragment of the painting which does. ##not vibrate, shimmer, or glisten....”253 In Balla’s role. that further dismantled the pictured struc. ##ture of colored light that had been so painstakingly analy. zed and practiced by Seurat and Signac (. ##following achievements in the art of Manet, J.M.W. Turner, D. egas, and Renoir, among others), Stree. ##t Lamp was the earliest portrayal of electric light as irradia. ted, near- abstract color and the ob. ##ject of the illumination, a Parisian street lamp.

When Electric Lamp is considered alongside other paintings of machines and electrical d. e. ##vices, including Goncharova’s, Dynamo Machine, 1913, exhibited together at the “No. 4” exhibition i.. ##n Moscow,255 it is apparent that fractured light is comparable in its execution in the Futurist pai. ##n. tings of Luigi Russolo, Maison + lumiére + ciel, 1912-13 (fig. 6); Gino Severini, Fête à Montmart. ##re,. 1913, (fig. 7); and, Umberto Boccioni, La forza di una strada, 1911 (fig. 8). Yet, Electric Lam. ##p is. most closely aligned with Balla’s Street Lamp in the shared testimony as the earliest examples. ##in I. taly and Russia of incandescent filament light from its source, the lamp.

Futurist painte. rs shared; for example, Severini wrote in the London catalogue for his firs. ##t exhibition, “My object. has been to convey the sensation of a body, lighted by electric lamps and. ##gyrating in the darkness o. f the Boulevard.”256 Yet, Boccioni’s observations brought him closer to. ##those of Balla in that, “.... a beam of light can cut through the environment with overwhelming visu. ##al directional force,”257 whic. h we find variously in his work.
On the cusp of the Great War, Marin. ##etti saw the “lyrical initiative. ”258 of the aesthetic of electricity as an expression of the subli. ##me. “Nothing is more beautiful tha. n a large, humming electric power plant which can contain the hy. ##draulic pressure of a mountain range. and the electric force of an entire horizon synthesized on the. ##distribution panels, spiked with pol. ished keyboards and switches.”259 The surrealistic poetic vis. ##ion saw that, “sparks are married to th. e stars / matches to lightning / crackle pinwheels bluish e. ##verywhere, / light curing World, / everyt. hing is torpedo. / Even the fireflies, almost, / popping. ##noises in light / in the dark night of the. flowers. Was made / harvest of stars /the bluish garland. ##s...”260 the network of electric light surro. unding the world. Electric light was “the white, new m. ##oon; the waterfall of lights which exult and r. umble in the sleeping cities;” “the fountains of lig. ##ht, the fiery pale iridescent wakes;” and, “the. reeling beams” replacing the pale shadows of the “d. ##ecrepit moon.”261
By 1914-15 the Futurist observa. tion that defined electric light by sharp edge an. ##d rigid shape was adapted to the stylizations of in. cendiary blasts and surveillance beams as the l. ##ight of war. The British artist, Christopher Richard. Wynne Nevinson, having gone to

France wit. h the Red Cross and having been inva. ##lided home soon afterwards, announced that he would be using “Fu. turist technique” to express the r. ##eality of the Great War as a horror sensed in his Futurist-Vortici. st canvas, Bursting Shell, 1915.. ##Shards of debris from an exploding building or bunker implode inwar. d spiraling toward a bright hy. ##pnotic center of light (fig. 10). Advances in war artillery and survei. llance techniques included t. ##he engineering of the “star shell,” a form of carrier projectile that wa. s effective in the illumin. ##ation of terrains known as No Man’s Land. Typically ignited at a height of. approximately six hundre. ##d meters, the star shell fell in a non-flammable parachute thus illuminatin. g the area that was oth. ##erwise difficult to gauge. The ejection process initiated a pyrotechnic flare. that emitted a blindi. ##ng white light. In Nevinson’s apocalyptic canvas, A Star Shell, 1916, (fig. 11. ), the startling lig. ##ht of an exploded “star” flare illuminates trenches carved into the barren war t. orn field serving. ##to expose those who were or were not there. The acetylene lights and Verey lights,. or flare guns, o. ##f trench warfare burst open the dark cavaties of ravaged earth illuminating the vio. lence of hurled. ##trees and roots, obliterated torsos, the carcases of donkeys and horses, and other d. ebris.

In the mud of Passchendaele in. 1917 some. ##men drawn in the huge, sewerlike craters filled with slime that comes of rain, earth, and. decomposi. ##tion. Some now begin to hear the bullets. Some are hit.”262
When the electric arc lamp was. deployed. ##for war after the American inventor, A. E.

Regarded by one, Jacques-Émile Blanc. he. ##, and his coterie of the Ballet Russe corps, the surveillant Zeppelin over Paris was reportedly a. t. ##hrilling site to behold. Removed from the true realities of war the effete groups imagined the air-.. ##ships as “giant whales or sharks in the sky,” a monster “...darting electric rays from his beacon e. ##y. es over the sleeping Ile de la Cité.”263 Electric beams acquired a somewhat programmatic style in. ##pr. inted matter and propaganda art during the war. In Jean Cocteau’s short-lived war journal, Le M. ##ot, t. he illustrator, Paul Iribe, created La Semaine des Anges (The Week of Angels), 1914-15, in wh. ##ich a l. arge angel with bowed head in hands hovers over Paris. The angel is fixed in a strong beam. ##of ground. surveillance light, which explains Iribe’s decision to cover her face (fig. 13). Despite. ##the double. meaning of the angel’s head in hands, to yield its sight from the blinding light and as. ##an expressi. on of despair, the reader is assured in the by-line at the bottom of the page, Heuresem. ##ent que nous. sommes invulnerables, (Luckily We are Invulnerable), as unrealistic optimism that Fran. ##ce was indeed. safe. The incisive tool of aerial and ground surveillance would continue to bring bom. ##bers to those s. ites captured by its scanning light. At the outset of the war, searchlights were co. ##mbined with acous. tic direction finders that guided the searchlights to the right parts of the sky,. ##which they swept u. ntil the desired target were fixed upon. After the end of the war the German de. ##velopment of searchli. ghts was effectively stopped by mandate of the Treaty of Versailles. The deve. ##lopment of surveillant. lighting resumed however in 1927 and was lauded as an icon of the Reich’s in. ##domitable power during t. he extravagant displays of the blinding light at the Nürnberg rallies eigh. ##t to ten years later.

As if the light bulb was in fact too foreign of an object, Maxim Gorky recalled the. ##story o. f a priest named Zolotnitskii who during a thirty-year imprisonment had worshiped a little. ##flame in. the stove of his cell. Upon his release in the early years of the twentieth century, he w. ##as horrifie. d in his first encounter with the, “white, bloodless fire imprisoned in glass....

A. ##t the end of th. e civil war in Russia the economy had collapsed; and, Lenin’s prediction that the R. ##evolution would u. nleash an international war of the classes had failed. Hundreds of thousands were. ##dying of famine. A. limited form of capitalism was instigated thereby gradually reviving the paltry. ##economy and despera. te conditions. In February of 1920, the All-Russian Central Executive Committe. ##e of the Soviets annou. nced the formation of a State Electrification Commission, known by the monik. ##er GOELRO. The task of t. he commission was to devise a general plan for electrifying the country vi. ##a the construction of a ne. twork of regional power stations. Ten months later, GOELRO presented its. ##plan, a document of more th. an five hundred pages, to the Eighth Congress of Soviets in Moscow. Th. ##e proposal, forecasting demand. through 1930 was infused by a utopian vision of a technologically ad. ##vanced society brimming with pr. oductivity and beaming with brightness. For Lenin, who devoted a su. ##bstantial contribution to the rep. ort, he promoted electrification as the single most critical aspe. ##ct in transforming Russia from an a. grarian peasant based country into one with a large-scale indus. ##trial foundation. Quite literally, he. insisted, this would bring "enlighten-ment" to the masses, th. ##us intoned in his famous maxim, "Commu. nism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole c. ##ountry."

277 Picabia’s li. ##ght bulb was a sentimental reference t. o Paris while he was exiled in New York during World War I.. ##“391” was a journal named after Alfred S. tieglitz’s renowned gallery and publication, “291.” It is. ##noteworthy to distinguish between Picabia’. s 1915 campaign of tools, lamps, cameras used as allegor. ##ical elements in a series of conceptual port. raits, including a common spark plug in Portrait d’une. ##jeune fille d’américaine dans l’etat nudité (. published in the July 15, 1915 “291”) a reference to. ##the indomitable Agnes (Mrs. Eugene) Meyer.

Sinc. e the invisible energy of elect. ##ricity was granted status of cause célèbre in Surrealism, in that the. theatrical effects of electri. ##c shock induced hysteria; the power surges of l'amour fou created mad. love; and, the vocabulary of. ##nerveaux and excitation were at the core of wildly inventive and transg. ressive works of art and li. ##terature, the light bulb was granted erotic status. The Picabia also infe. rs that the eroticized li. ##ght bulb is a portable object that may be inserted into a lamp socket anywh. ere at will. In the mec. ##hanism of its neon message, the implicit eroticism, now on now off now on aga. in would attract the. ##viewer, the voyeur, to peer into the glass bulb in order to witness the scene.. The aliveness, per s. ##e, of the interior of the Edison-Mazda bulb (fig. 19) was wrought in the electri. c signage, an exte. ##nsion of the “living” filament that is the image’s generative component of the ero. tic.
Found in ot. ##her examples of interwar years art, illustrations, and literature, the light bulb ha. d by then acqu. ##ired a somewhat iconic status.

Freud’s theories of the unconscious.278 Breton’s training as a young neurological medic contri. ##. buted to his encounters with the treatment of hysteria by electricity which had a direct effect up. ##on. the literary construction of the character Nadja in the eponymous fragmentary reflection in book. ##fo. rmat, Nadja (1928) (fig. 20). The work featured his admittedly insane lover, also his muse and. ##a pha. ntasm that according to Breton “...enjoyed imagining herself as a butterfly whose body consis. ##ted of. a Mazda bulb.”279 Advertisements of electric light bulbs were common in Paris, notable in th. ##e illust. ration work of René Pean who specialized in incandescent products typified in, La Lampe VI. ##XA, from 1. 925 conflating the butterfly or moth with the light bulb (fig. 21). The hybrid construct. ##ion of the b. utterfly-light bulb was not wholly imaginary given that Jacques-Andre Boiffard’s photo. ##graph of the M. AZDA light bulb was a symbolic portrait of Nadja. Breton later admitted, “...I am in. ##variably disturb. ed when I pass the luminous Mazda sign on the main boulevards, covering almost the. ##entire façade of. the Théâtre du Vaudeville...” (fig. 22).280

Coterminous to the era of Der wil. ##dgewordene Spie. sser, Hannah Höch trimmed a black and white advertisement of a tantalum tungsten bu. ##lb290 and pasted. into the scoop neckline of a bathing beauty’s torso in, Das Schöne Mädchen, 1919-2. ##0, a masterpiece o. f Dada collage (fig. 24). Höch, like Grosz and Heartfield, gave precedence to th. ##e light bulb as the. figure’s head and in Mädchen, it is also understood as a false sun. The young w. ##oman holds an umbrell. a to shield her face and body from the intense rays of the bare bulb. The sen. ##se of the light’s poten. cy recalls Emile Zola’s novel, Au Bonheur des dames (1883) in which the ele. ##ctric lights of the depar. tment store shined, “like a lighthouse, and seeming to be of itself the l. ##ife and light of the city... ..”291 But the optimism of the new lighting was worn down near the end. ##of the novel with the “...whi. te brightness of a blinding fixity. . . nothing now but this blinding. ##white light."292 Upon scrutiny. of the Höch the cutout light bulb is topped by a magazine clipping. ##of fine handiwork, a bit of lace. , that serves as a bow to top the light bulb head.

By 1906, having withstood the fi. ##rst photometric testing, The General Electric Co. mpany and the National Electric Lamp Company acqui. ##red the exclusive rights to manufacture the lamp i. n the United States. Tantalum lamps were describ. ##ed in bulletins up to November 20, 1910. They were u. sed almost exclusively through the White Star. ##ocean liners including the Titanic and the Olympic.

In Breton’s signific. ant analysis of Marcel Duchamp’s La. ##rge Glass, “Phare de La Mariée,” 1935 (Lighthouse of the Bride),2. 93 the lighthouse was attributed. ##to the “Bride,” which in itself was a sexual reference, just as the. nude in Étant Donnés’ would com. ##e to be highly sexualized in pose and attribution of its phallic bea. con-like lamp.

Far more interesting than the prosaic po. rtfolio of electric gadgets, Man Ray’s Emak Bak. ##ia (Leave Me Alone, 1926) is a masterpiece of early v. anguard cinema in which a relentless flow of. ##images interspersed with pure beams of light, bright sp. ots of incandescence, float on a solid blac. ##k ground followed by neon signage that runs across the ce. nter of the screen. Light is reflected in. ##wild prismatic striations filmed in a whirling array of gr. ey tones as glint cast upon undistingui. ##shed forms or as reflections in water and in contrasting shad. ows and brightness.

Part Two: Picasso’s 1912 and 1914 Ampoules Électriques
This is. a war universe. War all. ##the time. That is its nature. There may be other universes based on all sort. s of other principles,. ##but ours seems to be based on war and games.
In that the precedent of depicti. ng electric light an. ##d its counterpart the light bulb existed in myriad works of art by the advent of. analytical cubism,. ##the first of Picasso’s many representations of electric bulbs was the central fe. ature of the Meni. ##l Collection’s collage, Bouteille et verre, from late 1912 (fig. 33). Not only was. Picasso’s series. ##of fifteen revolutionizing collage-drawings compelling in their formal radicalism,. they were also. ##subversive political works via the specificity of the news reports which Picasso chos. e to cut and. ##paste from daily newspapers. The success of the campaign, on the whole, resides in term. s of except. ##ional drawing and the fragments of newsprint cut in proportion to the sheet’s terrain and. the objec. ##ts represented upon it. These, as are well known, introduced an utterly new conception of. pictorial. ##space.
In general, Picasso chose news items that were specifically tragic or threatening.. In more. ##than half of the sheets the clippings were about the Balkan Wars; the remainder of the serie. s focu. ##sed upon macabre human interest stories of suicides, murders, sickness, and thievery. The accu. mula. ##tion of them depicted, “with the blackest humor, a pathological bourgeois world gone mad.”316 In. Pa. ##tricia Leighton’s incisive and groundbreaking study317 she concluded that Picasso had not simply. us. ##ed front-page mastheads about the war, and certainly by 1913-14 the threat of another war sweeping.. ##across all of Europe; rather, he had

focused upon more personal stories as if they were café gossip spent over bistro tables. Th. ##e col. umns of newsprint that fill the bottles of the papiers collés, the “new in art,” Apollinaire. ##had wri. tten, “...they are already soaked with humanity.”318
The café still life, which evolved fro. ##m Picasso. ’s Céret period in 1910, a phase described by Pierre Daix, as “le lyrisme des terraces de. ##bistrot,”3. 19 is a central motif in cubism. Although the theme was far from novel in art or litera. ##ture by that. date, given that “the café took on an increasing role in social life. By the turn of t. ##he century,” w. rote Theodore Zeldin, “Paris had 27,000 and all of France 413,000. This period marke. ##d the apogee of. their importance.”320 The cubist table becomes the format for what would otherwise. ##be a traditional. setting. Picasso deployed a strategy of deduction in the still life; fragments of. ##newsprint are clue. s to the formulation of the image that is both visual and mental. And in this wa. ##y, the art of collag. e is exemplary for what it contains and what it does not.
Unlike other motifs. ##from the bistro milieu. —the Ace of Clubs playing cards, clay pipes, bottles of Bass ale, glasses of. ##absinthe, Vieux Marc, a. nd Pernod, and newspapers, whose lettering was pioneered by Braque and app. ##ears in Picasso’s tabletop. s typified in Journal, porte-allumette, pipe, verre, from the Fall of 19. ##11, (fig. 35) the headline “.

ver. y specificity and legibility of the stories contained in. ##the clippings that reveal a retraction agai. nst the tendency for cubism to become wholly abstract,. ##or incomprehensible, a “denouement steadfastl. y avoided by both Picasso and Braque.”321 The very n. ##ews of the day brought political, economic, and. social issues into the dynamism of the total work o. ##f art. With the first piece of newsprint clipped. from Le Journal, truncated as Le Jou, used in Guit. ##ar, partition, verre, post-November, 1912, (fig. 3. 6) the headline, “La Bataille S’Est Engagé”” rev. ##eals two things in the wording The Battle is Joined.. The masthead literally referred to the Balkan. ##Wars, and in allegorical and highly personal terms, i. t also alluded to Picasso’s own battle with t. ##he formal challenges that the unprecedented radicalism. that cubist collage posed.322 At the concept. ##ual center of the work, le jou, the play at hand, caused. the transformations that the papiers collé. ##s put into effect through Picasso’s sartorial wit and mas. terful eye. As Daix observed of the first. ##spare charcoal and single clipping works, “Never before di. d he present himself to the spectator,. ##not only without the tricks of the trade, but using means tha. t are within everyone’s grasp. And ne. ##ver before had a painter asserted his power as a creator, as a. poet in the strongest sense of the w. ##ord.”323
In that Picasso distinguished himself from the dominant. factions of bourgeois culture by a. ##n unparalleled aestheticism, his coded papiers collés articulated. the pre-war days in Paris from ne. ##ws items clipped from Le Journal. During the fractious era in whic. h the collages were created he h. ##ad embraced a political view that scorned the diplomatic

maneuvering of those years, and he wa. s drawn into heat. ##ed discussions with his coterie of French friends about their probable duties in th. e coming war. D. ##ue to the ominous events and promises of enmity, as the clippings present, the discus. sions and arg. ##uments grew intense in cafes all over Paris, nowhere more violently than at the artist’. s own, La R. ##otonde in Montparnasse.324 The contents of those arguments in the bar setting with bottle. s, glasse. ##s, café tables, and newspapers became all together the contents of the collages. Given that. Picasso. ##’s personal concerns were expressed in the radical form of cubist collage, journal also mean. s diar. ##y.
The Menil sheet, Bottle and Glass, includes a table, one bottle and a glass rendered in sch. emat. ##ic cubist fashion by the flattening of volumes and rotation of the top, bottom and sides of the. obj. ##ects. These vary in proximity to the frontal plane as determined by the weight of the hashed, cha. r. ##coal lines. At the center of the sheet, a bottle in three unequal parts telescopes vertically in ge.. ##ometric sequence from large to medium to small. The content of the bottle, the grey “liquid” newspr. ##i. nt was carefully trimmed as a trapezoid. The shape not only fills a portion of the largest of the. ##th. ree rectangles, its tapering tilts the solid shape backward in to the shallow space of the draw. ##ing s. o as to emphasize, quite nominally, another plane or dimension in the otherwise flat work. We. ##notice. that the volume of liquid is partial compared to that of the bottle in, Bouteille et violon. ##sur une. table, December 1912, (fig. 34) but in both the fragment achieves a sense of gravity. The. ##alignment. of the newsprint with the horizontal charcoal line, two-thirds down in the vertical regis. ##ter of Bot. tle and Glass describes the bottle in terms of its setting on the table. Picasso’s narro. ##wing of the. fragment toward the top of the bottle ends in a slight inverted curve alluding to the l. ##ip, otherwise. rendered as a flat line. Whereas Robert Rosenblum saw this feature entirely different. ##,

claiming that, “the skeletal linear network. ##transforms this b. ottle-shaped volume into a lamp base (with arced shade),”325 the content of the c. ##ontents of the bott. le is what interests us here.
On December 3, 1912, a news item with the headlin. ##e, “A Fontainebleau,. un Vagabond s’accuse d’un meurtre,” (At Fontainebleau a Vagabond is Accused of. ##Murder) caught Picass. o’s attention. In the columnar layout of the newspaper a murder story fell i. ##n line with two advertis. ements, one for Lacto-Phosphate de Chaux, a stomach remedy, and the other. ##for Lampe O. R. Electrique. light bulbs. To the left of that section of the page, Picasso cut throug. ##h a financial listing of me. tals industry profits that displayed percentages of gain or loss on the. ##commodities of zinc, pewter,. copper, gold and silver. The slice through the report was not arbitra. ##ry. Rather, in making the frag. ment correct in size and shape for the interior of the bottle, and g. ##iving full importance to the lig. ht bulb at center, the financial “border” was a social criticism t. ##hereby denoting Picasso’s sympathi. es about the inequities of the labor class.
His precision in cut. ##ting the shape of the “liquid” took. care to encompass the “readymade” narrative whose subjects of m. ##urder, illness, and financial markets. were uncannily illuminated by the additional chance of the li. ##ght bulb advertisement. The Societé Au. er ad claimed, La Seule qui éclairé dans toutes (The one who. ##shines in all directions) and La Seule. quie se place indifférement dans toutes les positions (The. ##one that is interchangeable in all positi. ons), which was seemingly the standard guarantee for the. ##light bulb. An information sheet or product. handout used the same image of a spiral tungsten bulb a. ##nd identical claims for the bulb’s solidite. du filament étiré supériorité du filament pressé, (supe. ##riority of the drawn filament extraction) (fi. gs. 37 and 38).326 Robert Rosenblum’s notable assessm. ##ent of the light

bulb described that the unique fea. ##ture, “... gives light on all sides and the only o. ne which can be placed in any position at all wh. ##ich is exactly what Picasso has done. Indeed, the lo. cation of the commercial illustration of the b. ##ulb in the center [is]... yet another example of Cubis. t sleight of hand.”327 And certainly this is. ##the case. Turning the bulb upside down, sideways, inver. ted one way or another was coequal to Pica. ##sso’s requisite maneuvering of objects in the collages.
Ho. wever, it is the specificity of the LAMP. ##E O.R. bulb in proximity to the tragedy that establishes a r. ecurring trait in Picasso’s oeuvre fro. ##m 1912-1962. In dozens of works the light bulb is almost exclu. sively included as the source of lig. ##ht in scenarios of conflict or battle, impending death, war, per. sonal loss, and tragedy. Bottle an. ##d Glass is the first instance in which this functional analogy occ. urs. The signification of electr. ##ic light in the work received treatment in every style; and, occurri. ng as it does in highly specif. ##ic situations, images of light bulbs and the sensual and visual effect. s of sharp incandescent ligh. ##t were constituted as ciphers of darkness.
In the double lbor of collage. as drawing and simulacrum. ##the light bulb must also be taken for its double meaning. The experience. of Bottle and Glass relies. ##upon the LAMPE O. R. to signify its technological function. In various ma. sterpieces of late analy. ##tical and synthetic cubism the bottle is a figure, is Harlequin, is a face,. and in those instances. ##the corporeal references are clear. In the only sheet in the campaign of twen. ty papiers collés fro. ##m late 1912 Bottle and Glass contains the only element of electric light.328 Ev. en the light in Bec. ##à gaz et guitare, (fig. 39) and a second version, Guitare, bec à gaz, flacon, (f. ig. 40) from the. ##327 Rosenblum, loc. cit.
328 In the only other collage that included a technologica. l innovation, s. ##uch as the LAMPE O. R. bulb, Picasso would include an advertisement for the Gramophon. e from a news. ##page that also featured a cold remedy, “La mycolysine et la phymalose du Docteur Doyen. ,” in Boute. ##ille et verre, early 1913, oil, sand and pasted paper on canvas.

same period reverts to the late nineteenth century gas lamp (fig. 41) with. its fan. ##-shaped flame drawn in a straight-forward manner in the backgrounds of each work. The bec à. gaz fix. ##tures are mere attributes of the bourgeois music room with carved wood paneling and its plast. ered. ##walls into which the gas line spout was fitted. But Picasso privileged the object in both title. s d. ##espite emphasis placed upon the guitar, so eloquently abstracted and repeated in sinuous form. Th. e. ##flamme du bec is, on the other hand, graphically unremarkable yet, it serves to signify the light.. ##of the civilized room.
Of the many guises that Picasso’s bottles would take it became a cinematograp. ##. h329 in the Bottle and Glass. The early movie projector was perfected by the renowned frères Lumiè. ##re. in the late 1890s, exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, and may have certainly. ##be. en seen by Picasso during his exuberant first visit there. In to the ‘teens of the early twenti. ##eth c. entury, the cinematograph proliferated in Nickelodeons and movie houses and was distributed w. ##orldwid. e as far away as India and China. The projector became the industry standard, and its basic. ##componen. ts included a long cylindrical lens that extended from a box-like housing known as the “m. ##agic lanter. n lamphouse” (fig. 42). The camera’s beam was directed on to the film, which was hand-c. ##ranked to pro. duce the moving image.
We refer back to the construction of the Menil bottle in three. ##parts. The lar. gest rectangle emulates of the lamphouse box out of which a long cylindrical lens e. ##xtends (fig. 43).. Here then the imaginary working prototype, for the bottle with its telescoping se. ##gments, must have. prompted Picasso to shape the battle thus during his consideration of the LAMPE O. ##.R. advertisement.. The light bulb serves to project a conceptual image from the “projector,” which. ##we take to be a comp. osited narrative of the news fragment, a sensational

script. about illness, death, and plunder. The beam of light is not present, but i. ##s conceptualized. The ima. ge is absent, yet inferred. As Barbara Rose has rightly summarized, “As a. ##ctual projection and psycho. logical projection coincide, these forms cut from one surface and attac. ##h to another, to enable to sh. uffle and overlap his motifs... exchange attributes...in the same sha. ##llow site at the same time.”330.

In 1942, Christian Zervos,. ##author of the Picasso catalogue raisonné, grouped and photographed. a collection of small handpainte. ##d paper cutouts, “elements of study,” created as potential attribut. es for the masterpiece of the A. ##vignon peirod, Portrait of a Young Girl, 1914 (fig. 44). Noted in the. Musée Picasso’s analysis of t. ##hese largely overlooked little items, deemed test pieces by Picasso be. fore being selected or rejec. ##ted for inclusion in the painting. Zervos made the point that in always. keeping tiny fragments of h. ##is work, that were seemingly trivial in character, these “bits” were othe. rwise “strengthened the d. ##o-it-yourself (bricolage)332 beauty of the work.”333 And as surmised by Bri. gitte Leal, a curator a. ##t the Musée Picasso, “Every bit of his work was an act of a conscious painter. wherein the importanc. ##e of detail and the sum of those parts, in combination of the application of c. ollage in to the str. ##ucture of painting was brought to an apotheosis.”334 During this period of excep. tional inventivene. ##ss, the transposition of the papiers collès into “terms of oil paint,” recognized. by Picasso’s grea. ##t patron, Douglas Cooper, “resulted in the synthetic methods of late Cubism [becomi. ng more surface. ##elaborated] and the further discovery that pasting and painting could be effectively. combined in o. ##ne picture.”335
The study elements were essentially attributes of a bourgeouis Parisia. n parlor tha. ##t the young girl, purportedly Picasso’s mistress, Marcelle Humbert, known as Eva Gouel,. might have. ##occupied. For her adornment and comfort he created several items including a feather boa;. three pai. ##rs of little gloves; three pipes, perhaps for himself or Apollinaire who was

In an analysis of interior ca. 1900, Simmel foun. ##d t. hat the distinction in common terms was understood through the changes in the attachment in soc. ##iety. to the objects or products, the problem of the commodity in the transition of the late ninetee. ##nth ce. ntury in to the early twentieth that he shared with Benjamin. He claimed that the state of f. ##amiliari. ty with familiar objects brought to an end the so-called “role of things” caused by a rest. ##ructuring. of family life that became more and more urbanized thus dislocated. The history of a fami. ##ly's things. , the revered clock, for example, which was bound in its meaning by the passing on of s. ##tories about. it within the continuum of the paterfamilias that was all but disappearing. We read of. ##this attitude. in Jean-Paul Sartre’s, The Words, "House and field reflect back to the young heir a. ##stable image of. himself. He touches . . . the diamond- shaped panes of his veranda, and makes of th. ##eir inertia the. deathless substance of his soul . . . I was not, he says, substantial or permanent,. ##I was not, he sa. ys, the future continuer of my father's work...."336 The differentiation of thing. ##s and behaviors are. accordingly related. Once those familiar objects became one and the same in a m. ##ultitude of commodit. ies, about which there were no stories to tell because they possessed no histo. ##ries, the sheer quanti. ty of

Ros. alind Krauss assigned an interpretaion of Portrait of a Young Girl t. ##hrough Ingres whereby the term ‘. Portrait,” she implored, already incited the master: “The nests of. ##concentric curves are there, as t. he figure is embraced by the rhymed patterns of the chair back,. ##the wreath of a feather boa, and her. own encircling arms. The painted reproduction of ornamental fa. ##brics is also a necessary component... .. Ingres enters cubism itself in the way the semiology of co. ##lor—the solution to how to produce a si. gn for chromatic experience [that will] insist on indirecti. ##on or mediation.”337 If the ornamentation. of the picture is understood to signify the young girl, v. ##is-à-vis Ingres or otherwise, it is the ve. ry absence of the girl who does not occupy her seat in t. ##he picture; but rather, is realized through. the attributes of the Études that function in a diarist. ##ic manner, thus continuing the strategy of th. e 1012 papiers collés. Against’ Krauss’s reading of t. ##he collage project as a whole, she denied its s. pecificity to narrative insisting that it, “convert. ##s the signifyng system into a naïve game of proje. ction. This does violence to Picasso’s evident co. ##ntrol over the sign’s circulation....”338 Against K. rauss’s formalist reading, we take thr the 1914. ##studies as parts of an intimate conversation. Perhap. s only Picasso knowing what the young girl, “. ##Eva,” preferred, and that her needs included warmth and. the bourgeois predisposition for finery. Th. ##e personalized room is nevertheless as fragile as world. conditions were that summer before the igni. ##tion of the conflagration that became the Great War.

Throughout 1915,. ##Eva had grown increasingly frail and ill with what would b. e diagnosed as tuberculosis. Continuing. ##the play of substitution instigated in the collages, yet wit. hout the additive fragments of real n. ##ewspapers or wallpapers, the portrait is a negative impression. of what would eventually be left beh. ##ind, so to speak, of what and who was not there given the illnes. s and imminent death of Eva in Dec. ##ember that year. If the girl in an armchair signifies a tragic mom. ent in the cloaked gaiety of the. ##green Avignon pictures, understanding color as a “sign for chromati. c experience,” according to Kr. ##auss, the cutouts signify the real potential in those items that were. presented with the girl and w. ##hat lay behind the them. Above all other objects in the paper studies a. bsented from the final vers. ##ion of the Portrait, the object-matter embodying potential reversibility,. that is, of fire versus e. ##lectricity was formulated in the burning logs and the light bulb that shar. e the same flamboyant ye. ##llow and red energy and the same bulbous shape (figs. 50 and 51). Light and. fire coexist in similar. ##form as if Picasso had yet to determined whether the room would include elec. tric light or the hea. ##t of a fireplace. In that both forms of heated light, the incandescent filament. bulb and the burnin. ##g light of the logs were at consideration, it was the painted cut-out of logs at. the feet of the Yo. ##ung Girl located on the paintings lower left side that took precedent.
In an oft-. quoted passage th. ##at Picasso wrote to his friend, Gertrude Stein, “My life is hell. Eva is still ill. and gets worse e. ##very day and now she has been in a nursing home for a month...my life is pretty mise. rable and I ha. ##rdly do any work, I run backwards and forwards to the nursing home and I spend half my. time in the. ##Métro...However I have done a picture of a Harlequin which I think in my opinion and se. veral peopl. ##e’s opinion is the best I have

Their leaning akimbo not only alludes to the implied non-fixity of cubis. t c. ##omponents, this pose specifically added to an escalating anthropomorphized bottle that performs t. h. ##e dance of death.

wandering trickster, acrobat, and master magician. The. ##1909 Harlequins depicted with. Saint Anthony, for example, are characters of expiation. According to. ##the Golden Legend, Saint Antho. ny was renowned for treating disease and helping the poor; and, in. ##Arlequin accoudé, 1909, and other. pre-cubist portraits depicting the pathos of Harlequin here hoode. ##d and grey, part-saint, part-vagab. ond, the holy fool.
Becoming Harlequin-filament was not a capric. ##e. For precisely within the interior. of the painted cutout light bulb, the body structure of the fu. ##ture Harlequin, 1915, was constituted. whole. In the morphologies of Harlequin he is typified by one. ##constant: the windowpane suit found i. n every representation of the character in all mediums and s. ##tyles from the seventeenth century forwa. rd. With the Études for Portrait of a Young Girl, Harlequi. ##n is realized as the light bulb’s wire fil. ament that was loosely based upon the common squirrel ca. ##ge bulb from the period. The figure is erect. and what would otherwise be a tungsten wire configurat. ##ion is the harlequinesque motley. Harlequin’s. body type included a small knob for the head, brought. ##forward from the bottle-head archetype, and a. stem below the connecting wires indicating two legs,. ##which would ostensibly “grounded” the figure i. n to the electrical contact component. Standing in. ##the light, causing the light within the emanating. vacuum, the Harlequin-filament, like the light bu. ##lb in general is both a resistor and a conductor.. In simplistic scientific terms that may be applie. ##d to the allegory, the temperature of a light bulb. is dependent upon resistance that obeys the amou. ##nt of current for heat/illumination distribution. A. good conductor, on the other hand, allows the e. ##lectricity to easily flow through a circuitry without. insulators or other materials that block the. ##energy.

205

corpse, the. ##candle's immense vibrancy—the power of paint discharged in e. motive strength redolent of Van Gogh’s. ##hand—expresses the sensation that another life burns on in ab. sence of the living flesh. Even at t. ##his early date, Picasso, age twenty, possessed a keen awareness. and sensitivity to symbolic and pic. ##torial light. He brought the radiance of the candle as close as p. ossible to Casagemas whereby the. ##light stops short of touching his profile. This strategy is seen ag. ain in Guernica in which the ra. ##ys of light from the candlelight are exuded toward the onerous rays o. f the electric sun but they d. ##o not touch or intermingle in any way.
The glass bulb, in effect a Pica. sso-esque mandorla, housed. ##a technological homunculus, the little man in a bottle so praised by Para. celsus whose ancient herm. ##etic symbolism, typified in the alchemical treatise, Splendor Solis, Alchem. ical Treatise of Solomo. ##n Trismosin, 1582, (fig. 55) was not lost in Picasso’s version. In another se. nse, the fully formed. ##Harlequin in the bulb was another of his profane inversions of the tradition o. f Christus oriens,. ##of the God of Light residing and coexistent with the sun. The paradigm was taken. in full form in an. ##other manner with the sketch, Homme Tenant une Pipe assise devant un Table, 1914,. (fig. 56) drawn d. ##uring Picasso’s bedside visitations to Eva. Here, the crowned and crucified Christ. is depicted agai. ##nst a full and radiant sun. And unlike the iconographic tradition which Picasso, the. young altar bo. ##y in Malaga knew from personal knowledge and witness, this Christ of the deathbed, wh. o does not sa. ##ve Eva, is a Christ who is darkened and smokes a pipe.
The light bulb will not recur in. Picasso’s w. ##ork during the Great War or the interwar years again until 1934. But as we shall read in. Chapter 4,. ##its signification and power in the writing, works on paper, etchings, and paintings lead. ing up to. ##Guernica are significant for the ways in which he conceives anew the light bulb as the sig. nifier. ##of terrible incandescence.

its signification as a tragic motif is considered in a brief s. umm. ##ary of a four works to close this chapter that began with the collage of 1912.
As Roland Penrose. cl. ##aimed, “The same sinister background of war and privation makes itself felt in many of the still-l.. ##ifes of this period just as music in the form of guitar- playing and songs had been the theme or man. ##. y Cubist paintings in the days before the First World War, so food in its more humble forms; such. ##as. sausages and leeks, together with the skulls of animals and the dim light of candles and shaded. ##lam. ps recur throughout Picasso's wartime paintings.”341 One of the most salient examples of electr. ##ic li. ght made during the Nazi Occupation of Paris is Nature morte au boudin, May 10, 1941, a harro. ##wing al. legorization of war’s slaughter and bleak subsistence in which strong overhead light is emi. ##tted from. a common hanging fixture; the triangular shade is notably black (fig. 57). Light shines u. ##pon a tabl. e laden with a coil of saucisson, specifically boudin or blood sausage.342 The butcher’s. ##prominent k. nife is seemingly implicated in cutting the coil of meat, a carnal omphalos, and, the. ##two chopped ar. tichokes, resodolent of hands, a symbol of helplessness and famine. The room is clau. ##strophobic, as m. ost of Picasso’s wartime rooms were, the ceiling is low, and the lateral walls clo. ##se in without any. openings to the outside. There is nothing to relieve the sobriety of the grisaill. ##e, the palette of m. ourning. As Picasso himself had said of the work, it has “an atmosphere like Ph. ##ilip II, dark and dis. mal.”343
The electric light is most telling in its role within the symbolic m. ##onstrosity that the pic. ture entails. The coil of meat may be thought of with regard to Bataille’s. ##article, “Abbatoir,” publ. ished in Documents (1929) that relied upon Marcel Mauss’s theory of sacri. ##fice

via the slaughterhouses of s. ##uburban Paris’s La Villette. Accor. ding to Denis Hollier, the essay describes a sacred horror that. ##corresponds to culture as the “negat. ive pole, the generator of repulsion, the centrifuge placed fa. ##rther and farther away from the center. of the city.”344 Carnage is removed. Yet, Picasso reifies th. ##e bloodletting and meat as food and as. sacrifice. In an anonymous wartime pamphlet a butcher who ha. ##s hacked off a segment from a large coil. of sausage is accompanied by a cryptic by-line that reads,. ##“the last of red tape distribution;” (fi. g. 58) and, on the opposite page the imprint of the butch. ##er’s bloody hand is signature of that fact;. or, of the larger signification of massive bloodshed.
I. ##n Picasso’s Boudin that Zervos felt, “speaks. of persecution,”345 and that Françoise Gilot remarked,. ##“gave form to his fears,”346 we are given a. highly personal version of slaughter, made clear in th. ##e light of the electric lamp. This light would. grow no darker than in, Cruche et chandelle, Februar. ##y 20, 1945, (fig. 59), made during a winter mar. ked by the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops. ##; the bombing of Dresden; and, the revelations co. ncerning the dreadful news of the Manila massacre. ##in the Phillipines. Candles took their requisite s. ymbolic form throughout Picasso’s wartime pictu. ##res, acting as the constant companion to settings of. mournful objects and interiors heavy with drea. ##d. In Pitcher and Candle, the wick’s flame is both a n. oose and a dangling light bulb. The candle i. ##tself is blade- like emphasized by the steely white tip. against the cave-like walls of the room. Fo. ##r how would Picasso have known otherwise that the liberat. ion of a desperate world would occur in A. ##ugust of that year?

Between 1930 and the creation of the exploding electric sun of Guernica, Picass. ##o depicted varia. tions of the sun in over fifty works. These ostensibly created a sequence of disti. ##nctive metanarrati. ves on natural light that proved as important a leitmotif as those of the acclai. ##med bull, horse, bat. hers, and portraits of women of the same years.

Here then, the. ##Spaniard, a lover of the sun as we know f. rom photographs of him at the beach, or working bare- che. ##sted and tanned at Antibes and Juan-les-Pin. s, thoroughly appreciated its vibrancy although he coun. ##tered and attacked it as if it were a carnal. enemy of his soul.

The black sun of melancholy, or metanoia, a. p. ##ersonal turning inward, to change purpose or have mental perception was depicted variously in many.. ##scenarios culminating in the Baigneuses sous soleil noir in the winter of 1937, which conceptually.. ##prefigured the sense of bleak incandescence of the electric sun.

In the series of seven ink sketchbook drawings, Femme assise, from August 8. ##of 1932, the. sun is linked with Picasso’s young paramour, Marie-Thèrése, who sits out of doors in. ##the scenes (fi. g. 8). Radiance virtually crowns her head. This disposition lasts through four of th. ##e sketches. By t. he fifth, Picasso has introduced a crow, agent of the nigredo that flies in to and. ##intrudes the maid. en’s sphere of calm causing her to wince and look downward. Here is the candle b. ##earer of the Minotau. romachy, 1935, and in other depictions of her innocence, whose truth, in the f. ##orm of light, confront. s the Giant, the Minotaur that shields his sight from the candle’s radiance.. ##In the sixth of the Fem. me assise drawings, the raven’s blackness is repeated in Marie-Therese’s s. ##tartling black eye thus im. buing her, by its magic, with the potential of darkness. The paradigm su. ##ited Picasso’s fears. Marie-. Thèrése had contracted a serious illness350 and it was thought that sh. ##e in fact might lose her life.. In the final drawing, the sun has been nearly obliterated by the bla. ##ck bird; and, Marie-Thèrése see. ms complacent enough, perhaps a hopeful expression of Picasso’s vis. ##ion of her return to health. She. is drawn in large profile with the same weight of hand used for th. ##e sun thereby making them cotermin. ous (fig. 9). But the deeper implication of the crow as a specte. ##r of death is recalled in ancient te. xts and illustrations of its perch on a human skeleton’s shoul. ##der, the bone-figure balancing upon th. e sphere of its world, the black sun351 (fig. 10).
350 Marie. ##-Therese’s family recalled that in 1932. she had bathed in the sewer-befouled Marne River and having. ##had a small cut on her foot, she caught. a particularly malignant virus which doctors thought came. ##from a rat bite. “Her illness required a l. ong convalescence and it was thought that she was going. ##to die, She lost all of her hair and had bec. ome skeletal.” Summarized from Josep Palau I Fabre, Pi. ##casso, From the Minotaur to Guernica (1927 – 1. 939) ed.

In another form, the sun. ##virtually explodes in the background of the 1934 illust. ration for Aristophanes’s anti-war drama,. ##Lysistrata (fig. 4). Amid the environment of post-war Fran. ce’s rappel de l’ordre, the “mood of pea. ##ce and harmony [with] ...reconciliation of two warriors, one. Spartan, one Athenian”352 was aligned. ##with the larger agendas of peace in Europe notwithstanding th. e reality of the civil war in Spain.. ##However, Picasso, who made the drawing while blindfolded in ord. er to create a spontaneous reaction. ##to the Greek narrative, rendered a sun replete with emotive powe. r. Here again, the sun is a form. ##of darkness and is a premonitory element that far outweighs the act. ion of the soldiers despite the. ##ir being foregrounded in the thematic drawing.
Notwithstanding the in. herent uniqueness of each ver. ##sion of the sun aforementioned, the unsurpassed Crucifixion, 1930, is t. he primary subject of this. ##section (fig. 11). Found in the small picture is the most harrowing and n. early indescribable sun i. ##n all of Picasso’s oeuvre. The Parisian art critic and friend of Picasso, P. ierre Cabanne, had desc. ##ribed the painting as, “a sacred delirium and one at the same time, sacrilege. ... a summit of parad. ##ox or cynicism, but above all...the most overwhelming expression of [Picasso’s]. surrender to destin. ##y.”353 Crucifixion is arresting in its aporetic, anti-sacramental tenor that was. understood by Lydi. ##a Gasman, through her prodigious interpretation of the 1926-1936 “Magic Crucifixi. ons” as the, “.... ##tension between the sacrilegious and orthodox... what Maurice Sachs called, in 1926. , ‘Picasso’s Ca. ##tholicism.’354 Indeed, [they]...do not break with ‘Catholic

dogma, but to use a favorite phrase of Picasso’s, they ‘violate’ Catholicism.”355 Th. e pa. ##nel painting was radical in its diversion from official Church doctrine, which in spite of, was. rem. ##arkably consistent with Spanish faith, an “adulterated, depraved mysticism” that remained a profo. u. ##nd “mysticism and faith” dominated by the tragic notion of The Passion.356 On its own terms, Crucif.. ##ixion purported the “holy promiscuity of the executioner and victim”357 inherent in primitive sacri. ##f. icial rites. It is therefore neither a re-presentation of the crucifixion from Christological his. ##tor. y, nor is it in accord with the western iconographic canon.
Rather, by the effects of radical c. ##harac. terizations and a rearrangement of the Crucifixion sequence as recorded in the Gospels, the p. ##ainting. ruptures the sacred narrative. Sanctity was confronted by hysteria; redemption was coiled w. ##ith scor. n; and, the banality of obscenity was undifferentiated from the holy. When taken altogethe. ##r, as Geor. ges Bataille did, Crucifixion is a Dionysian work of total destruction. Noted as semi-bi. ##ographical,. the picture has been summarized as a phantasm that mirrored, “Picasso’s metamorphoses i. ##nto fate.”358. And not unlike Guernica, Crucifixion may be regarded as a form of skenographia, here. ##the “scene” is. another tragic theatre piece. Whereas the sun in Picasso’s 1917 curtain study for Je. ##an Cocteau’s pr. oduction of “Parade,” a scene of joyful ambience (fig. 12), the sun being carefully. ##taken up to the. sky on a ladder notable for its many rungs like that of the Scala paradisi of St.. ##John of Climacus,3. 59 which Picasso repeatedly depicted in various works including Crucifixion, 193. ##0 (figs. 13 and 15)..

players. ##populated by what William. Rubin termed, “compound object-personages”360 or monsters. Many of the f. ##igures are exclusive to Cruc. ifixion, whereas others had been disgorged and refashioned from Picass. ##o’s work of late ‘20s. These a. berrations of nature or imagination were the very person-ification o. ##f chaos. The Virgin Mary is harr. owing and eroticized; a sub-human praying mantis is poised to be t. ##he crucifier atop the ladder; dise. mbodied legs, arms, and feet are tossed akimbo; an infantilized. ##imatatio Christi, a form of the pinh. ead bottle-harlequins of synthetic cubism stuns by the mere un. ##sophistication and implicit muteness o. f the figure; and other hybrid ritualistic characters, inclu. ##ding a sui generis sun composed of many. attributes drawn from solar theologies, and, its pendant to. ##the left side of Christ, the “Pincer-mon. ster,”361 are unparalleled in Picasso’s pantheon of alleg. ##orical personages. T. J. Clark, quoting Pic. asso, wrote, “Monstrosity, he is fond of saying, moves. ##the picture out of the realm of art into that. of the thing, the object.”362 In this instance, the t. ##otal essence of the art object was a re-enactm. ent, in Picasso’s fetishistic terms, of the death of. ##Christ in which the sun of the eclipse was so d. isclaimed as to its being incongruous to tradition. ##al symbolic forms of its likenesses, therefore a c. omic figure as well as a nearly unidentifiable o. ##ne.

radiographic. analyses of the pentimenti. The V. ##irgin was originally painted entirely in black, from which we may. conclude that her features were a. ##rticulated in white. In the evolution of the picture, which was pai. nted in one sitting on February. ##7, 1930, Picasso may have recalled the little black virgin of his yo. uth, the Romanesque Virgin of. ##Montserrat known as La Morenata. The miraculous black virgin was insta. lled on the altar of her na. ##mesake, the monastery Santa Maria de Montserrat. She was associated with. conjugal sexuality sanctio. ##ned by the Church, and therefore she was venerated for her blessing of new. lyweds and married coupl. ##es. Such was her popularity and renown that in 1881, the year of Picasso’s b. irth, Pope Leo XIII cr. ##owned her as the sacred patroness of Catalonia, whom the artist would come to. be familiar with duri. ##ng his years growing up in Barcelona. And, he would also certainly have been ke. enly aware of the s. ##exual lore of Morenata. In 1930, Picasso’s initial urge to represent a black Virg. in was neverthele. ##ss achieved in the final version of the Virgin Mary who is a paradigm of evil, an a. bject symbol an. ##d archetype of the dark Mother fashioned as she is in Crucifixion as a devouring dent. ata noire Mad. ##onna.
Picasso’s daemonic Virgin is configured with Christ implying a range of heretical. notions. In. ##the drama of the picture, if she could turn from profile stance to face Christ, and the. reby impla. ##nt the front of her body, not the side, the shift brings into the imagination a mutual cru. cifixion. ##and the dynamic of ecstatic Eros-Thanatos. Consider the hands. They are simultaneously sepa. rate a. ##nd joined, enduring the nails of the crucifixion. The right hand is a shared one. It extends f. rom. ##the shoulder of the Virgin and is equivalent in size and position to the right hand of Christ th. at. ##extends from His extending left side. The left hand stretches upward crossing into the zone of ye.. ##llow light, and fastened to the cross by one red nail

hammered in place by the insect-cruci. ##. fier.363 The potential of mutual suffering is inferred if we allow that the Virgin shared the limb. ##s. and hands of Christ. The ambiguous white right arm and hand extend from her “shoulder” behind the. ##ve. il. Christ does not have a right arm clearly articulated as the left one is; yet, in His shared. ##spac. ed with the Virgin, Picasso has implied that the white right arm and hand are shared. A black. ##nail s. ecures Christ’s white left foot to the suppedaneum, or footrest of the cross. The right han. ##d and foo. t of Christ-and- Virgin are not nailed to the beam and thereby Christ’s imminent death fa. ##ils in this. setting. He is left in the limbo of un-time. And the Virgin then, by design, is also bo. ##th attached. and unattached in the fateful process. Julie Kristeva speaks of the mother as the Other. ##, impelled “b. y a libido that is less Eros than Death....”364 Citing Picasso and de Kooning’s women. ##through Batail. le, it is the “death-mother, to catch hold of her, frontally or obliquely, but to c. ##atch her just the. same within the grid of [the] work..... In short, we are dealing with a mother wh. ##o knows no taboo... .. [and is] Potentially psychotizing.”365
Here then, against taboo the Virgin-an. ##d-Christ become one. in both un-differentiated whiteness and un-differentiated sacrifice. The unorth. ##odox union gives cred. ence to a non- divisive form of consciousness in that their “oneness” is alig. ##ned with the hermetic A. ndrogyne, which sparked discourse and a following in surrealist art and wri. ##tings, and was held by Br. eton as an elect union. In alchemical terms, such a union was achievable. ##through an admixture of opp. osites of the prima materia, the base elements of chaos being mercury a. ##nd sulphur, from which transf. ormation and enlightenment could be formulated. Accordingly,
363 It i. ##s not insignificant to note tha. t within the totalizing metamorphosis of characterizations in the p. ##ainting, William Rubin called the. nail-driver, “a monstrous little red figure, the most surreal thi. ##ng in all Picasso” who had “itself. metamorphosed into the shape of nails, the role being hallucinat. ##orily confused with the actor.“ Wil. liam Rubin, Dada and Surrealist Art (New York: Harry N. Abrams,. ##1985), p. 291.

alchem. ##ical unification required the separation. of opposites followed by acts of violence, pain, and death. ##—the stages of putrefaction and purificat. ion—that resulted in the achievement of the “one thing.”. ##An analysis of symbolic color in Crucifixio. n must be left to another study, yet, it is worth notin. ##g that according to the notations in, “On the. Colours which Appear in the Preparation of the Stone,. ##” from the alchemical treatise, Splendor Solis. (1582), the precept Trismosin claimed: “Whereof PYTH. ##AGORAS says, ‘The more the colours change the s. tronger you must make the fire, of which you must n. ##ot be afraid. For the Matter is fixed in the Whit. e, and the species fly not from it.’”366 That the. ##, “species fly not,” finds parallel expression in t. he state of suspension “fixed in the White” of. ##the 1930 Christ-and-Virgin.
In spatiotemporal terms,. Crucifixion radically restructured The Passion. ##at Golgotha. In a claustrophobic rearrangement the mo. mentous event was collapsed into a synchroni. ##c moment. In so doing, Picasso’s chronology of the stage. s leading up to and following Christ’s cru. ##cifixion was seemingly ad hoc and disturbingly rearranged.. 367 An example is
366 Splendor Solis: Al. ##chemical Treatises of Solomon Trismosin, trans. Julius Kohn. (1582) (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tru. ##bner & Co., 1920), p. 131. Trismosin was an adept and the tea. cher of Paracelsus.
367 The disorder. ##of the crucifixion events, according to Biblical accounts, also. includes the following outstanding. ##revisions made by Picasso in Crucifixion: 1.) The cast of dice f. or Christ’s tunic which He remaine. ##d draped with and not stripped of belies the accuracy of His impen. ding death: “Then the soldiers,. ##when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments (ta himatia) and di. vided them into four parts, to. ##every soldier a part, and the coat (kai ton chitona). Now the coat wa. s without seam, woven whole. ##from the top down. Therefore, they said among themselves, let us not tea. r it, but cast lots for it. ##, whose it will become. Thus the saying in Scripture was fulfilled: they d. ivided My raiment (ta im. ##atia) among them, and upon My vesture (epi ton himatismon) did they cast lot. s,” John 19: 23-24. 2.. ##) In advance of Christ’s death, the Lance of Longinus, or Holy Spear, is thrus. t by a miniscule bul. ##lfight-picador-centurion only to penetrate the outstretched robe, thus denying t. he mortal wound, c. ##ontrary to John 19: 34, “...after Jesus was dead, a Roman soldier pierced His side. with a lance and. ##forthwith came there out blood and water.” 3.) On the left of the composition, to. Christ’s right,. ##a “Pincer-Monster” (McKinnon’s term, 2015) arches over and encapsulates the vignette. of the picador. ##. The Pincer screams at Christ and the “evil teeth” screeching- white Mary, a picto-a. uditory eleme. ##nt. Although the “Pincer-Monster” is a term coined here by the author, Kaufman had iden. tified the. ##character as, “hieratic,” and Gasman, as a “screaming jaw-figure” (Gasman, 1981, p. 1052). . More pr. ##ecisely, the pincer was a tool in the Arma Christi used to remove the

represented. in the. ##horrific act of nailing the body to the beams of the cross that purportedly occurred on the. ground. ##before the victim was erected on the cross in to place.368 In the Picasso, Christ was made ve. rtica. ##l during the act of driving the nail. The ladder that the praying mantis-crucifier has climbed. atop. ##, lends further confusion since the nail-driver is typically seen as an element of the Depositio. n.. ##With the lamentation of the three Marys, the lancing of Christ’s side, the raising of the vinegar.. ##-soaked sponge, the throw of dice for the tunic, the rolling away of the stone of the sepulchre, the. ##. nailing of the body with the Arma Christi, the crucifixion eclipse of the sun—all these sacred sta. ##g. es are all-at-once out-of- step.369 As such, the scene is construed as a breakdown.
The temporal. ##fol. ding-in of events is performed as a sense of un-time that was equaled in a sense of un-space in. ##the. orchestrated, pell-mell composition. Pictorial space is alluded to
nails from Christ’s hands a. ##nd fee. t; and thus, Picasso’s reformulation of the tool into a mandibular “creature” is joined by t. ##he other. “Mouth of Hell” figures, including the dentata noire Virgin Mary, and, the blue praying-ma. ##ntis Olga. -Magdalen (identified by Gasman and discussed in Chapter VII of “Mystery, Magic, Love...”. ##) at the bo. ttom right of the painting. 4.) Above Pincer-monster, as if by magic to deny gravity, a. ##round green. “rock” floats and abuts the back of its skull. The rock is specifically unique in that. ##it is the onl. y element in Crucifixion that Picasso gave dimension to, emphasizing its bulk and so. ##lidity, and as d. epicted, the denial of weight. In 1949, Alfred Barr, Jr. was the first to suggest. ##that the green orb. was, “perhaps the vinegar-soaked sponge enlarged to gigantic size and isolated l. ##ike one of the obje. cts in the traditional paintings of the symbols of the Passion.” (Alfred Barr,. ##Jr. Picasso: Fifty Ye. ars of His Art, (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1946, p. 167). Barr’s suppos. ##ition was not refuted i. n critical readings of the painting by scholars, including Roland Penrose (. ##1958), William Rubin (196. 8), or Ruth Kaufman (1969), despite the probability that the image was mo. ##re than what Barr had propo. sed. What Picasso may clearly have meant the orb to symbolize is unreco. ##rded; however, the articulati. on of the shape suggests that it is a rock, and in accord with the co. ##llapse of chronology in the pai. nting, the very rock of the sepulcher rolled away from the empty to. ##mb of the arisen Christ, which ca. nnot be discounted for the placement of the bird as well. Further. ##more, granted the general acceptanc. e of Mithraic symbolism the sponge-rock is the green moon of Mi. ##thraism, the rock from which Mithras. was born, and the Pincer-Monster is Mithras-Atlas who hoists t. ##he giant world on its back, vis-à-vis. the Farnese Atlas who bears the cosmic globe, repeated in Goy. ##a’s masterful drawing of a man of burde. n in 1651, see figs. 21-24, p. 32 this text.
368 For exampl. ##e, see Albrecht Dürer’s, Seven Sorrows of. the Virgin, ca. 1496.
369 Picasso’s revisionist tendencie. ##s are exemplified in an anecdote from Rich. ardson (2007, p. 396) in which he quotes Picasso recalli. ##ng to Apollinaire his disregard to copy a Mu. rillo in a church commission of altarpieces in Barcelo. ##na during his youth: ”The idea bored me so I c. opied them up to a point, then rearranged things acc. ##ording to my own ideas.”

Apropos of Picasso. ’s re-sequencing against historical continuity,. ##consider Benjamin's, "Theses on the Philosophy of Hi. story," in which he asserted that modern memo. ##ry and societal revolutionary tensions would act in con. cert to explode the diachronic continuum. I. ##n fact, there is no real assurance that the correspondenc. e between the articulations of the past w. ##ith the present, represented by the Crucifixion event in th. is instance, are guaranteed, as Benjami. ##n’s project of the dialectical image would suggest. Or, in ot. her words, the necessary corresponden. ##ce that depends upon an articulation of the past, by way of the. image, may not coalesce. As Benjami. ##n believed, such is the conundrum of modern culture: "The past c. an be seized only as an image whic. ##h flashes up at an instant when it is recognized and is never seen. again."370 Benjamin’s sense of A. ##ugenblick, or “blink of an eye,” takes form in the confused tempora. l dimension of Crucifixion, whi. ##ch Picasso had conjured. Citing Benjamin, the Australian anthropologi. st, Michael Taussig, summariz. ##ed the kind of hysterical fixity that Crucifixion exudes:
Therefore, if. the accent is on the side o. ##f the volcanic rupture, what Benjamin elsewhere called the Jetzteit, the. presence-filled now-time—n. ##ot homogenous, empty, evolutionary time—it must be appreciated that this. rhythm is in the midst of. ##its violence also a time of enormous stillness... no less than... modern m. emory in search of corre. ##spondence in a festival- less world. This is the stillness of shock, suspend. ed out of time. This i. ##s the work of the negative, as in Bataille's notion of sovereignty, in which t. he limit is transgre. ##ssed.371

Picasso’s domineering re-orchestration of the Stations of the Cross, and. prophesied mo. ##ments leading up to and following Christ’s death, also included a bold transposition o. f the sun an. ##d moon by the artist-puppeteer who moved the sun to Christ’s left, or the viewer’s right. .

T. ##hese are altogether. unclear in Picasso’s chronic divulgence of doubt that is a summation of his int. ##ent.
The long-held v. iew that the sun was a singular “sun-and-moon” character located in the backgr. ##ound to the immediate. right of Christ was put forth by the art historian, Ruth Kaufman, in her dist. ##inguished analysis, “Pi. casso’s Crucifixion 1930” (1969). Kaufman submitted that the sun was one ha. ##lf of the blue and yellow. double-faced figure, which she had identified through its precursor, Tête. ##, November 22, 1929 (fig.. 16). To substantiate this element in Crucifixion as the image of the sun,. ##and therefore to establish. her reading of Mithraic sacrifice through the sun, she submitted that t. ##he “sun side” of the face th. at was overlaid with a triangle, an abstracted form of the Phrygian ca. ##p typical of Mithras’s general. attire. Kaufman wrote, the “... triangular hat seems likely to be a. ##reference to Mithras, the youth. ful sun god who... sacrificed a bull, [and] was depicted on reliefs. ##wearing a peaked cap.”373 On the. theory that Picasso's attitude to the crucifixion exemplified pri. ##mitive sacrifice, Mithraic ritual. included the slashing of the bull’s throat as a rite of expiation. ##; therefore, it makes eminent sense. that the placement of the sun beside the crucified Christ and t. ##he symbol of “another primitive reli. gion, which employed sacrifice as a central part of its ritual. ##”374 was arranged in that manner.

374 Ibid. Kaufman noted Barr in reference to. ##the article, “Idoles des Cyclades,” by Et. ienne Michon, Cahiers d'art, (Vol. 4, 1929), p. 257, citi. ##ng Barr for his idea that the totemic Chris. t emulated Cycladic figures, thus the primitive nature. ##of Christ, Kaufman felt that the iconographic. similarities, thus the potential of ritual imprint fo. ##und in Three Dancers, 1925, and Crucifixion, 1. 930, were indisputable. “The left-hand figure has a. ##moon image forming the left side of her face and. this combined with her ‘convulsive’ posture and th. ##e night scene seems to suggest the performance of. magic. At the same time, the pose of the central. ##figure is strikingly similar to that of a crucifie. d Christ. The combination of the crucifixion and. ##suggestions of night magic takes the former out of. its traditional context and places it within th. ##e realm of primitive religious ritual.”

Yet. , if the Phrygian cap-shape substantiated Kau. ##fman’s rationale, she did not consider Picasso’s double. -head portraits of the mid-to-late 1920s (f. ##igs. 17-19) that continued the influence of “split” face. primitive masks whose imprint was paramoun. ##t in Picasso’s portraiture since 1907. That the multiple o. r double-faced African mask symbolized h. ##eightened powers of perception would have been important to. Picasso’s adaptation of magic inherent. ##to the picture. And a finer point may be placed upon a counte. r- interpretation to Kaufman’s in tha. ##t the “sun-and-moon” image, clearly lifted from the 1929 oil pa. inting, Tête, is also simply a scul. ##ptural head on a pedestal. During this period Picasso made many s. ketches of triangular “faces” upo. ##n modeling armatures (fig. 20) that we see repeated in studies for. the studio, culminating, for exa. ##mple, in, L’atelier, from late 1927-28 (fig. 21). It is also general. ly held that the double-portra. ##it of Tête was a bust of Marie-Thèrése conflated with that of Olga, Pi. casso’s estranged wife. In t. ##his form, Picasso placed the two women near the center of the Crucifixio. n scene in order to “witne. ##ss” the Christ and Virgin in mortal battle, agreed by many scholars to be. symbolic of Picasso’s fig. ##ht to separate from Olga.375
In overall terms, Tête of 1929 shares basic si. milarities with other p. ##recariously balanced and geometrically articulated heads represented in singl. e portraits and studi. ##o scenes from the period. However, the simplicity of the “sun-and-moon” charact. er, or sculptural b. ##ust of Marie-Thèrése-Olga, seems weak in light of the potent symbolism of other d. ramatis personae. ##in the painting. Picasso would have imbued this figure, so close to Christ on the c. ross, with laye. ##red meanings in accord with the multiplicity of inverted meanings in Crucifixion. For. example, the. ##double portrait could also reference the god Janus. Despite the tradition of the Roman. god’s conjoi. ##ned double-heads looking outward and not inward, the

Janus’ function in the archaic panth. eon was. ##to preside over transitions from one state to another, from the past to the unpredictable fu. ture.. ##The versatile incarnations of Janus, representing January in the astrological scheme of Renais. san. ##ce iconography, were placed in programs as the Keeper of the Gates to the Otherworld, or, as the. Gu. ##ardian of the threshold that controlled the doors opening onto the realms of heaven and hell, as w.. ##e see in the thirteenth century carving of a watchful Janus created for the grandiose Porta dei Pell. ##. egrini of the Cathedral of Ferrara (fig. 22). If the double-faced figure was placed to watch the d. ##es. tiny of Christ, therefore, does Picasso’s inference of limbo, between life and death, suggest th. ##at H. is fate is undetermined and with it Christian mankind? If so, granted that the double-faced po. ##rtrait. is proposed as Janus, would not his supervision of the future be relevant to the scene?
What. ##may be. left to additional speculation is that the third Mary of the Crucifixion was not identified. ##in Cruc. ifixion. Picasso was careful to include the major participants as recorded in Biblical acc. ##ounts. And. given the ambiguous if not two-to-three-fold nature of meanings scripted for many of the. ##characters. , the double-faced Janus may perhaps also be the third Mary, Mary of Cleopas, mother of. ##James. She w. as in attendance at the crucifixion alongside Mary Magdalene, who appears as a blue m. ##andibular monst. er to the right of the white Virgin Mary. Mary of Cleopas was explicitly mentioned. ##in John 19:25, “N. ow there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary [t. ##he wife] of Clopas,. and Mary Magdalene.” The Tête figure is therefore an undetermined element in th. ##e Crucifixion. And i. f we grant these interpretive possibilities, by association they would allow a. ##release of the sun ch. aracter from the conundrum of dismissive, critical readings that have narrow. ##ed its symbolic possibil. ity.

There was no precedent in Picasso’s work for the portrayal o. ##f the wholly bizarre figur. e taken otherwise to be the sun; nor, like the electric sun of Guernica. ##does it appear in any work t. hereafter. What is termed in this analysis as the “biped-sun,”376 is a. ##composite of attributes adapt. ed from three solar theologies, archaic iconography and lore, and su. ##bjective determinations that com. prise a complex identity. As a character player, given the essenti. ##ally theatrical nature of Crucifix. ion, the biped sun is of preeminent relevance to Picasso’s defia. ##nce against the natural order of thi. ngs. In the doom-laden, feria-colored scene the sun is present. ##ed in parodic guise as a totemic perso. nage. It’s confounding elements include a body shape that is. ##both torso or chiton, and lacking arms;. a large head or nimbus; two small feet turned left in prof. ##ile; a large red blindfold; a belt ambigu. ously drawn as a smile, or vice versa; and, what has esca. ##ped all analyses to date, a “light-tipped”. quiver of arrows flung at a diagonal across the back of. ##the figure. Energy exudes in green sparks fr. om the crown of the nimbus or disc-like head thereby e. ##nlivening the otherwise static symbol as a pot. ential source of radiance. And here I invoke the quo. ##te that opens this chapter: “The sun and moon st. ood still in their habitation; at the light of you. ##r arrows as they speed, and at the shining of thy. glittering spear...” Habakkuk 3:11. Kaufman, for. ##one, regarded the [sun] figure, noted here as the b. iped-sun, as an anonymous member of a triumvira. ##te of “generalized cult figures” that appear to the l. eft and right of Christ which, “on a purely f. ##ormal level, united by their similarity of stance, bein. g symmetrical and frontal in contrast to th. ##e other figures in profile. The very frontality and symme. try of the three figures suggest a hierat. ##ic meaning.”377 Other scholars have opined that the confoun. ding figure is, “...like a sun with hai. ##r, which could

also be interpreted. ##as the head of Saint John;”378 is, “a most bizarre yellow fig. ure with two neat yellow feet, multi. ##colored flinging and an oddly shaped red center containing dotte. d features like those of Christ;”3. ##79 the “ ...grinning carnivalesque entity on the horizon at right. is so weird as to displace any de. ##finition, a resistance that points to the second stratagem by which. Picasso exceeds the iconography. ##: by sacrificing the icon itself;”380 and, “...he remains an anomaly. with his scrotum-shaped visage. ##, which may or may not refer to the testicles of the Mithraic bull.”3. 81
To the contrary, the sun d. ##oes not displace any definition. Its attributes were specifically deter. mined from a range of varia. ##nts that Picasso possessed in his intellect and memory. In combination as. they are, he created a hy. ##brid sun that was a fantastical admixture of symbolic referents. And in so. doing, this sun overturn. ##ed the deepest tradition of the New Sun of Christ emphasized by His triumph. ant rising.

Righteousness ever rises.. ##and where the true Light is born.” 382 In early Church liturgies and liturgical chants, Christus Or. ##. iens became interchangeable with Christ as Sol iustitiae,383 the Messianic sun of justice, later c. ##on. forming to Sol salutis, the Son of God venerated as the Sun/Son of salvation. The decisive impul. ##se f. or developing a Christian solar theology came from the portentous words of Malachi 4:2, “But u. ##nto yo. u that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and ye s. ##hall go. forth...” prompting Cyril of Alexandria to submit, “Christ rises upon the world as the Sun. ##of Justic. e, of most perfect knowledge, enlightening our eyes and souls.”384
Still, in the violated. ##/violent at. mosphere of Crucifixion neither the aura of Sol iustitiae nor Sol salutis were presente. ##d. The dignit. y of the historic salvific sun was replaced by a conceptual model of the official sol. ##ar deity of the. later Roman Empire (274 AD), the invincible Sol invictus, known by the epithet, Hel. ##ios Magistos, th. e Great Helios and “Unconquerable” sun. According to Mithraic lore, Sol Invictus c. ##rushed the enemy b. y its blinding appearance.385 For Roman Mithraic iconography a distinction was d. ##rawn between the sun. god, Sol, and the celestial lord of the fixed stars, Mithras, who at times was. ##invoked as the combi. ned Mithras deus Sol Invictus. The comparative religions scholar, David Ulans. ##ey, proposed a reading. of rare Mithraic inscriptions in which Mithras was regarded as the sun god,. ##hence the conflated pers. onification of Mithras and Sol Invictus,386 or, Mithras the Unconquerable.. ##In a parallel line of tho. ught, Ulansey also posed the problem of a

“conquer. ##able” sun, asking if it might be found,. and “...of course,” he wrote, “Mithraic iconography gives a. ##n absolutely explicit answer:
...scenes. depicting the sun god kneeling before Mithras or otherwise. ##submitting to him make it abundantly clea. r that it is the sun itself who is actually the conquered. ##sun. And so we may say that Mithras is ent. itled to be called “sun” insofar as he has taken over t. ##he role of kosmokrator formerly exercised by. the sun itself. Thus the entire relationship between H. ##elios and Mithras become fully explicable: Hel. ios bows sometimes to Mithras in recognition of Mith. ##ras’s superior ability to shift the entire cosmi. c structure. And Mithras is called the “unconquere. ##rd sun” as an acknowledgement of the fact that he. has taken over the role of kosmokrator which form. ##erly was the sole prerogative of the now conquered. sun.”387
Picasso’s tool of control was the force. ##of his art that by necessity satirized providence.. In the possible adaptation of the Mithraic Sol. ##for his purposes, the “new sun” of 1930 demonstrated. an outrage against the crisis of that which is. ##unconquerable, the fate of Death.

Recalling Pi. ##casso’s morphology of Harlequin being the masked, comic servant in the complex lore o. f the commedi. ##a dell’arte, the masked sun also attained meaning through models of Alchemy. In 1903, G. uillaume Ap. ##ollinaire had coined the phrase “arlequin trismegiste,” a reference to Hermes Trismegistu. s, avatar. ##of the Thrice Great Hermes and guide of the soul to worlds beyond the visible, likening th. e assoc. ##iation to Picasso whom the great poet regarded as an “ascendant” and sun-like being. Followin. g his. ##tremendous significance in a role as charmer and specter, Picasso killed off Harlequin in 1906. at. ##the beginning of his Pink Period. As is known, Harlequin was then resurrected and reconstructed. ove. ##r the course of cubism and reached his penultimate state as the Great Harlequin, the grinning bla. c. ##k and white specter of death in 1915, prefigured as the Harlequin-filament in the light bulb study.. ##from 1914. In 1930, Picasso’s interpolation of Harlequin with the biped sun in Crucifixion created a. ##. new figure in his compendium that extends a consideration of Mithraism in the picture, and purport. ##s. to claim a new ascription of the sun that differs from Kaufman’s theory, in the character, “Mithr. ##as. Sol-Harlequin.”

Apropos of features on the red. ##mask the schemati. c simplicity of Gabon Fang masks, which Picasso collected, are notable for small,. ##closely set eyes.. In the retellings about his initial visit to the Musée d’Ethnographie to André M. ##alraux and others, P. icasso exuberantly described over and over again his discovery of the “primiti. ##ve,” and a feeling of. “shock,” a “revelation,” and a “force.”
William Rubin, in deference to Gasman. ##’s breakthrough scholar. ship surmised that, “it was the ‘magical’ conception of art as catharsis th. ##at first claimed Picasso. in the masks....”392 The overlay of mask-like eyes upon the red face mask,. ##a “double masking” of sor. ts, reifies the sun as a blinded source of light. Picasso’s early obsess. ##ion with blindness began in. the Blue Period represented by two early masterpieces of “lost sight,”. ##Le repas de l'aveugle, 1902-. 03, replete in Eucharistic overtones of the aged blind man’s meal of b. ##read and wine; and, La Célesti. ne, 1904, in which the half-blind procuress, Celestina, a talented p. ##uta vieja, or old whore, holds r. osary beads emblematic of her transgressions and religious hypocri. ##sy. The essence of blindness, sacr. ifice, and speciousness in both paintings is consistent with tho. ##se in Crucifixion. But rather than t. he natural decline of sight through macular disease or old age. ##, Picasso has “blinded” the sun in his. masking of the figure that he alone exerted control over.

 244. Crucifixion,393 claimed, “The sun, from the human p. ##oint of view is the most elevated conception. It. is also the most abstract object, since it is impo. ##ssible to look at fixedly at that time of day. If. ...one obstinately focuses on it, a certain madne. ##ss is implied, and the notion changes meaning it is. no longer production that appears in light, but. ##refuse or combustion adequately expressed by the ho. rror emanating from a brilliant arc lamp.”394. ##Bataille’s equation of the blinding sun and the horror. of malevolent, electric light and his defini. ##ng terms of “refuse,” that is, “anything that is reject. ed, discarded, waste, or, residue,” and in. ##extended use that which is, “despised, outcast, or worthl. ess” and “combustion,” meaning, “the acti. ##on or process of burning; consumption or destruction by fir. e,”395 led him to equate the sun’s blin. ##ding power with animal sacrifice, “...the scrutinized sun is. identified with a man who slays a bull. ##(Mithra).”396 Again, we do not witness the sacrifice of a bul. l in Crucifixion. Picasso’s obsessio. ##n with the corrida, from the 1890’s onward had no bearing upon B. ataille’s expressions of taurochto. ##ny, or, the slashing of the bull’s throat in which established ico. nography always depicts Mithras. ##holding the bull’s head backward, by the nostrils, and slitting the. throat. The ritualized sun alig. ##ned with the bull posits it within the domain of sacrificial blood ri. tes.

As edito. r of the e. ##thnographic vanguard journal, Documents, Bataille had placed “Rotten Sun” after the poem,. “Flames,”. ##by Jacques Baron, one of the signers of the Surrealist Manifesto whose metaphor for artist. ic visi. ##on was phrased, “pockets full of sun...his eyes are streams of solidified light.”397 The issu. e’s a. ##ttention to sun and sight has been well noted; and, Bataille went further in his writing to cla. im. ##that, “All of this leads one to say that the summit of elevation is in practice confused with a s. u. ##dden fall of unheard of violence.398 That violence is blindness. Once looked at, the sun turns rott.. ##en and black and dies. And both before and after 1930 the light of the sun was a central characteri. ##s. tic of Bataille’s mystical theories of degradation. In the essay, “L’Obelisk” (1938), we find an. ##ove. rlay of sun symbols of the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde, a monument termed a “petr. ##ified. sunbeam”399 once the site of routine guillotine killings, and was erected in honor of the Egy. ##ptian. Sun god Ra inscribed in hieroglyph that expressed in its simple solidity and basis in sacred. ##geometr. y the truth anticipated in the incarnation of the Son of God, the light of the world.

Picasso gro. unded the sun, so to speak, in Crucifixion, by applying feet to the figure thereby co. ##mmanding its ad. herence from celestial realms to the laws of gravity.

hell,” “mud,”. “darkness,” “filth,” “shame,” and the “gaze of low idiocy,” the “Fall,”. ##and “death.”401 The “low”402. feet of the biped sun conflate Bataille’s premise of filth and the “Fa. ##ll” with the lore of Mithras. Sol Invictus whose intrinsic triumph as light over evil established hi. ##m as the “unconquerable.” The. biped sun is then both an invincible figure and a “low” figure with m. ##ortal origins.
Picasso created. all of the legs and feet in the painting as solid shapes evocative o. ##f the limbs of the Beatus of Lié. bana illuminated manuscript, the Saint-Sever Beatus, or, The Apoca. ##lypse of Saint-Sever that includes. the miniature, Cheveaux Monstrous, 1072 AD (fig. 28). In Bataill. ##e’s commentary on The Apocalypse an. d what he claimed was the most “surprising” element was that th. ##e fundamental content of the manuscri. pt page was colored by a humor that, far from dampening the h. ##orror, rendered the figures all the mor. e horrible. This has nothing to do with the reflexivity of. ##irony. To the contrary, given that humor. is in the original sense of “humor,” of and from the flesh. ##in which it is embedded, it was once the. name for the consistency of the flesh and its fundamental. ##disposition in the doctrine of the four hu. mours.403 And it is the odd form, between the flesh and. ##the immateriality of light that the comic, a. d hoc biped sun subsists as.

Ra-Horakhty symbo. lized the sun at its zenith epitomized b. ##y the full sun disc. The disc doubled in Picasso’s work as a. Roman shield, which was discovered upo. ##n examination of the pentimente of Crucifixion. In Christian. iconography, a bust of Christ in the d. ##isk of the sun was found as early as the ninth century in the. Chludoff Psalter where the Helios-Chr. ##ist had been adapted to the Canticle of Habakkuk. A variation o. f the theme is found in a Greek Psa. ##lter in the Vatican where Zacharias is kneeling in prayer while a. bove the rocks, there rises in th. ##e sky (E yous), below the ark of heaven, the sun-disk with the bust. of Christ.404
It is not viable. ##to conjecture the depths to which Picasso’s instincts may have drive. n his quest in Crucifixion; bu. ##t, given the torque on Christian sacrifice admixed with the implicatio. ns of cultic taurochtony, th. ##e conflation of Christian/Mithraic sacrificial ritual served to magnify. the intrinsic polarities of. ##Light/Good versus Darkness/Evil that define the painting. Our subject, t. he sun, abides as many th. ##ings. And in final consideration of it in this text, I cite the Avesta of I. ranian Mithraism, the s. ##acred text of Zoroastrianism. The renowned archaeologist, Franz Cumont, held. that Mithras was regar. ##ded as the “genius of celestial light. He was not sun or moon or any star, but. the spirit of light,. ##ever wakeful, watching with a hundred eyes.”405 In the Mihr Yasht, or the anci. ent “Hymn to Mithra. ##,” the refrain, “For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth. being heard...”40. ##6 was repeated. This declares no reasonable bearing on Crucifixion since Picasso’s. general knowledg. ##e of Mithraism was acquired through Leiris in accord with Bataille’s interests. Des. pite that the r. ##eference to the Avesta is wholly obscure, consider nevertheless the expression of the. sun, “ever wa. ##keful,

Part Two: Electric Seraphim in the Bullring,. ##1934-1935
Whoe. ver has not seen this blazing Spain does not know what the sun is; whoever has not h. ##eard sounds of t. he arena does not know what noise is.... On entering that circle in flames, our fi. ##rst impulse was to. turn back.408
With the introduction of the light bulb in cubist works on paper f. ##rom 1912 and 1914,. electric light began its course in Picasso’s work as a signifier of malevolence.. ##With the Harlequin-. filament’s invocation of the medieval Her-lequin, inhabitant of the realms of. ##Hell and officiator of. death, the 1914 light bulb anticipated its full-blown force as an arbiter of. ##mortality in 1915, as. discussed in Chapter 3. Given Picasso’s perception of a failing order of nat. ##ure that spawned a compl. ex agenda of attacks upon the sun, the substitution of natural light with. ##artificial light in bullfi. ghting scenes originated in the mid-1930s. The pivotal exchange of the s. ##un with electric light comme. nced in a campaign from 1934, and throughout it, an aerial figure will. ##eventually develop into a sig. nificant version of the electric sun in April of 1935, which I have. ##termed, “seraphim-light bulbs.”4. 09 This reemergence of incandescence expressed Picasso’s command o. ##f its metaphorical strength as an. exquisite and complex inversion of light.
Indisputably, the visua. ##l and aural dramas inherent in much. of Picasso’s work achieved a shrill pitch in the 1934-35 mortal. ##entanglements in the corrida. Playe. d out in over thirty course de taureaux compositions, the ritu. ##al of the bullfight elicited brutality. and fights to the death with a new intensity. July 16 of ’34. ##saw the start of a bloody spectacle of. the bull goring the mare or horse with overwhelming rage.

period of Picasso’s long en. ##gagement with the theme of the bullfight. And ye. t, in some depictions, the bull was anthropomorphi. ##zed to the extent that the expression of a conscie. nce is revealed through the humors of the face,. ##as in a furrowed brow, as if suddenly the beast had. become aware of the total havoc it had created.. ##In these few cases the bull was left alone in the ri. ng demonstrated in, Taureau mourant, July 16. ##1934, a portrait of the dying bull, gone from killer to. victim, and frozen in time as if it were en. ##cased in a glassed-in exhibit in which to study its lame. ntable state (fig. 30).
We will find in ma. ##ny of the works from this campaign compositions in which P. icasso splayed the horse and bull flat a. ##gainst the picture plane, as if the bulls alone were in homa. ge to the cave drawings at Tito Bustil. ##lo in Asturias. In others, Picasso, the aficionado, shows us t. he bull according to precise definit. ##ions of its stance, coloring and size, its “psychology,” or disp. osition in relation to the horse o. ##r matador and to the crowd, and the qualifying attributes of horns. , tails, hoofs, and bone structu. ##res. The articulation of the muscles in Taureau mourant, for example. , typifies the categories of a. ##pretado de carnes410 that refers to a muscle-bound bull, or literally. “tight meat;” and, the promin. ##ence of criadillos, or testicles is never a secondary thought in Picass. o’s descriptive visual lang. ##uage of the bull. In this version, which is a cameo portrayal lacking any. other figures or outside. ##references, the dying bull has fallen on its front right and back left leg. s. It staunchly struggle. ##s to stay up and alive felt in the determined back left leg whose hoof was s. unk into the front for. ##eground corner. This stance will be repeated in all dispositions of the bull t. hereby using the leg. ##for its geometric thrust in to the right corner of each work discussed here tha. t is countered on. ##the by the horse’s crippled left leg. As for the bull’s expression, the bared teet. h and desperate. ##bulging eyes signify its last moments.

Snarled horses and bulls are enmeshed as unequi. vocal predat. ##ory characters, each one becoming the victim or the slayer in differing scenes, but most. ly, the bu. ##ll is on the attack. In one of two Course de taureaux paintings from July 22, a monster-bu. ll raise. ##d on its haunches, therefore, a Minotaur, was branded across its torso, “Boisgeloup 22 Juill. et XXX. ##IV” (fig. 31). The inscription was not typical of Picasso’s finished canvases, which he genera. lly. ##dated in neutral areas. Rather, the black hide served to record the place and date of the slaugh. te. ##ring of the horse thereby recording the bull as the executioner. In a role as matador-slayer, not. o. ##nly had the bull succeeded in performing the atravesada, the act of piercing the opposing animal by.. ##traversing it from a side angle, the “performance” had occurred at approximately 4:05 PM told by th. ##. e small black clock at the top of the scene. According to bullfighting tradition, the official sta. ##rt. time of main events is 4:00 PM sharp; the killing had, therefore, only taken minutes to achieve.. ##My. interpretation of the clock counters that of the Spanish authority on Picasso, Josep Palau i Fa. ##bre,. who wrote, “Picasso must have learned of the death of Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, from one or othe. ##r of. his Spanish friends in Paris.... It is too much of a coincidence, that clock stopped at five o. ##’clock. and that black-the black of mourning-should predominate....”411 In fact, Mejías died on Augu. ##st 13 i. n the Plaza of Manzanares in Madrid, which would make of the July 22 canvas a premonitory w. ##ork of th. e matador’s death in the ring, rather than one of a series of sacrificial corridas that l. ##ead directl. y to Guernica.

Cirlot noted in the Dictionary of Symbols the “phallic significanc. ##e”412 of the arrow,. which Gasman had termed “Picasso’s magic weapon,”413 that may also be taken to. ##mean the matador’s sw. ord. Jung, in discussing the alchemical symbol of the arrow that dissolves or. ##kills, wrote, “Mercuri. us is the archer, who chemically dissolves the gold, and morally, pierces t. ##he soul with the dart of. passion.”414 The Courses de taureaux series have generally been regarded f. ##or their biographical refe. rence to the “face-off” between Picasso’s volatile wife, Olga, and her d. ##iscovery of his paramour, th. e young Marie-Thèrése; but, equally, of the warring conditions in Spai. ##n marked by the October Revolu. tion of 1934.415
The works that would follow became more anguished a. ##nd furious, and the figures more. animated yet abstracted as we witness in the bull that stands over. ##a mare in its death throes from. the second Course de taureaux painting from July 22 (fig. 32). In. ##this barbaric image segments of th. e horse’s contorted body are enunciated to the extent that Picas. ##so has quite nearly abandoned the te. ndency to supply the animals with anthropomorphic or semi- rea. ##listic attention. We are left with an. emphasis upon carefully articulated teeth and simple circles. ##for eyes, nostrils and knee joints. The. picture’s decorative treatment is reminiscent of the acclai. ##med, Jeune fille devant un miroir, Marie. -Thérèse, May 14, 1932 (fig. 33) in the borrowing of its b. ##lack tracery applied to the elegantly asse. mbled carnage.

415 Although P. icasso was less focused upon the events in Germany. ##than he would be in 1936, we note that Adolf Hitl. er, in a merger of the roles of Chancellor and P. ##resident was elected Führer in August of 1934. Prior. to his election, in July of ’34, he orchestrat. ##ed the murder of old enemies amounting to the deaths. of eighty-five members of the paramilitary Bro. ##wnshirts in a “purge” known as the “Night of the Long.

penchant for subsuming a t. ##heme into surface effects was unmistakable. The correla. te of the young girl at the mirror responds. ##to Picasso’s repetition of Marie-Thérèse’s profile seen. four times around the arena. Her artless v. ##isage looks down from various seats in the stands to empha. size her role as a witness to the fight,. ##an enforcement of her seeing the black bull devour the whit. e horse that Picasso seemingly insiste. ##d upon.
Despite an attempt to thwart the bull in Femme a la bo. ugie, combat entre le teaureau et le. ##cheval, July 24, signified by the reoccurrence of his “P” sword. thrust in to the upper back, or en. ##morillado, the big tossing muscle, the bull tears through horse e. ntrails (fig. 34). Picasso has ut. ##ilized his talent in the art of etching to create a particularly go. ry black scene that is punctuat. ##ed by the candlelight thrust forward by the Marie-Thèrèse figure, who. must in any event shield her. ##eyes from the carnage. His reengagement with certain tenets of surreal. ism is evident in various as. ##pects of the work from 1934 to the extent that a transgressive tenor cou. ntermanded the classical e. ##legance and self-engagement of the Suite Vollard of 1933 that preceded the. fierce corrida campaign.. ##In several of the Vollard sheets Picasso gave exquisite renderings of hims. elf as a classicized an. ##d erotic bull in amorous couplings within extravagant Mediterranean salons an. d generalized studio. ##settings.
In the progression of the bullfight theme, Taureau et cheval, painted. on July 24, 1934, p. ##resents the bull as an all-out killing machine (fig. 35). A palpable simulation. of hatred is felt t. ##hrough Picasso’s artistry that leads one’s eye down the finely articulated serpen. tine neck of the. ##beast, past the fixed madness of its eyes, the stony bridge of the nose, flared nos. trils and wretc. ##hed muzzle, into a mouth of anthropomorphized super-teeth. The lurching death-posture. repeats that. ##in what must be considered a more benign rendition of the slaughter from July 22 (fig.. 32). In Taur. ##eau et cheval, Picasso has emphasized a repulsive tongue that becomes one with the entr. ails of the. ##horse, the carcass so crudely exposed to

show two hoofs that differ little from. the grizz. ##ly mass. The bull’s stepping into the slain horse was an unheralded form of possession and. disregar. ##d, and a new plateau of violence in Picasso’s work. The implication was apropos of the meta. phorica. ##l praxes under his control, and the deep paradigm of viciousness that may be augmented throug. h a c. ##onsideration of Bataille’s theory of the mouth.
In what Rosalind Krauss has called, “the anatom. ica. ##l geography of Bataille’s thought,”416 bouche, or “mouth” was redefined in terms of its “biologic. a. ##l axis” that connected it to the anus. With this redefinition, the action or each body component wa.. ##s a “real transformation of articulate sounds into bestial ones, the moments of man’s greatest pain. ##. or pleasure....”417 In Documents (1930) Bataille published Boiffard’s full-page photographic “port. ##ra. it” of an open mouth with very wet lips and a salacious full tongue (fig. 36). In its applicatio. ##n to. Taureau et cheval, the proximity of mouths to anuses is amplified in Bataillean affinity. Pica. ##sso’s. emphasis upon the anatomical feature of the anus of the bull, and at times the horse alike, h. ##ad not. developed from Bataille’s theory of basses, or low materialism. The orifice had already been. ##codifi. ed in the jouer of cubism represented by the leitmotif of the Ace of clubs, black dots on d. ##ice, and. certainly the black holes of the “solar anus” as in the squared circle of the sun in La cr. ##ucifixion,. August 21, 1938 (fig. 37). As Gasman determined, the affinity between, “Bataille and Pic. ##asso was su. ch that, almost exactly like Picasso, Bataille equated the sacred with the anus, the “b. ##linding” “rot. ten sun,” Christ and the beloved with “l’anus [et] la nuit.”418
Bataille began his es. ##say, “The mouth. is the beginning or, if one prefers, the prow of
animals; in the most characteristi. ##c cases, it is t. he most living part, in other words, the most

terrif. ying for neighboring animals.”419 The precise emphasis that, “human life is s. ##till bestially concentr. ated in the mouth: rage makes men grind their teeth, while terror and atroc. ##ious suffering turn the m. outh into the organ of rending screams. On this subject it is easy to obs. ##erve that the overwhelmed i. ndividual throws back his head while frenetically stretching his neck i. ##n such a way that the mouth b. ecomes, as much as possible, an extension of the spinal column,”420 i. ##s repeated in renderings of the. anguished horse more than any other character in Picasso’s entire o. ##euvre. The tormented posture of. the impaled horse, with its head thrown back in a pitiful near vert. ##ical incline characterizes the wo. rks from July 22, 24, and 27 (figs. 31, 32, and 35).
By July 27,. ##a third duo of Course de taureaux p. aintings were more highly colored and compact in their arrangem. ##ents. In the first of two works made. that day, a pale horse in five parts, otherwise an S-shaped to. ##rso and two pairs of legs, is flattene. d across the picture plane in front an equally flattened bla. ##ck bull (fig. 38). Picasso maintained th. e decorative quality of the July 24 horse and bull, but th. ##ree days later the pale blue stripes have. softened and are more haphazardly applied to the horse as. ##are the striations on the bull that are ar. tificial in the sense that they do not articulate the a. ##natomy in any manner. Here, the horse’s legs. are akimbo if not broken, and they curl upward and dow. ##nward and expose what would be a middle-ground. space, which we see through to. This figuration is a. ##n open form, the horse becoming glyph, and it i. s derivative of the languid nudes of 1929 whose gau. ##nt limbs conformed to a lazy, looping geometric s. een in Femme couchée (fig. 39). Picasso nearly re. ##peats the nude’s left leg thrown up high and archin. g that in both paintings reveals a triangular s. ##hape underneath the crook of the knee. In the volume. of the belly, which is a plane of atmospheric. ##pale primary colors of the reclining woman, the horse. is split and guts

and blood have spilled from the hollow of it. s rib cage that is held open by the bull’s. ##tool- like front legs. The horse’s head, once again, is t. orqued backwards in an impossible arc the. ##reby exposing its neck to the devouring jaw of its predator. .
Whereas the previous pictures had inc. ##luded only a horse and bull, the later of two paintings creat. ed on June 27 introduced new figures. ##to the corrida. This painting will mark the beginning of a shor. t-lived series of Course de taureau. ##x works from July to September of 1934, and taken up again in Apr. il of ’35. In each one the placem. ##ent of characters remained identical, expressing a resoluteness tha. t reflected the symbolic depend. ##ency of each character to another. In the confines of the arena, whic. h was another version of Pica. ##sso’s interiors, the time of day is understood through the atmosphere o. f sol y sombra, the light-a. ##nd-shadow of the bullring depicted in his earliest renditions of the bull. fight from 1896 and 1900.. ##For example, in a group of pastels from the spring of 1900 drawn in celebr. ation of the opening of. ##the bullfighting season, the young Picasso’s afición, or enthusiasm, was pal. pable. The scorching. ##midday sun was equaled by the coolness of its passing over the bullring rendere. d in strong cadmium. ##yellows and grey-blue-greens that emit the sensations of heat and its waning int. ensity in the sha. ##dows of the afternoon.
Richardson noted that the scenes were a “tremendous advance. not only in brav. ##ura but in color. Picasso has finally discovered how to paint light,”421 which we se. e in the paste. ##l drawing, Courses de taureaux, spring 1900 (fig. 40). The young artist had captured t. he moods of. ##Andalusia and Catalonia in shadowy and glaring light, and color alike. But it was not me. rely that. ##Picasso had learned to paint light, light was the absolute metaphysical counterforce to da. rkness,. ##and in varying degrees it revealed the world to him.

 267. was t. ##wice dragged to the edge of the bullring. Shadows encapsulate the carcass that lies just withi. n th. ##e perimeter of the arena beyond the arena of stunning light. The dismal image was discovered in. ano. ##ther version by x-radiography of the substrata of The Tragedy, 1903, which is visible in the lowe. r. ##right corner of the negative. The metamorphosis of the painting, like many others, was a “sum of d.. ##estructions” in which a writhing and near-dead horse appeared in the 1901 layer of the same paintin. ##g. .
When conservators at the National Gallery of Art in Washington probed the ‘01 layer at a differ. ##ent. x-radiographic wavelength, rather than “showing an enhanced image of the discovered bullring co. ##mpos. ition, the new infrared image revealed a thin stage of drawing of...a prancing horse with a bo. ##und ta. il...as well as another figure in motion.”422 The x-rays revealed that during the developmen. ##t of The. Tragedy Picasso had abandoned the work and produced a similar scene in the crude sketch, C. ##ourse de. taureaux: l’arrastre, from July 1902. In it, two men lead a mule that drags a dead horse f. ##rom beyond. the framing of the scene. The head is nearly identical to the horse discovered in the x-. ##ray of The. Tragedy, and with the horses killed in the 1896 and 1900 works aforementioned. The relev. ##ance of this. particular example to our understanding of Picasso’s sense of pictorial light is told. ##through the i. nterconnection of the working layers and subjects. In 1934, Picasso surmised to his p. ##ublisher, Chris. tian Zervos, “Perhaps one would perceive the path taken by the mind in order to put. ##its dreams into. a concrete form. But what is really very curious is to observe that fundamentally. ##the picture does n. ot change, that despite appearances the initial vision remains almost intact.”42. ##3 The initial sketch. es of the death of the horse and segue into l’arrastre, literally the “pull” o. ##f the carcass by a mul. e team across the dirt floor of the

bullring, confirms Picasso’s preoccupation with suffering. ##that he placed in shadow. It m. ay be said that the requisite high afternoon sun of the bullfight wa. ##s, in Picasso’s mind, irreconcil. able as distinctly non-separate from the darker spectrums of light. ##.
Not only does the second paintin. g from July 27 introduce a female toreador depicted in the guise. ##of Marie-Thérèse who appears on the. viewer’s right (figs. 41), the painting style heralds a bravur. ##a of brushwork that loosens as near c. alligraphy in its assured handling. Whereas Paulu i Fabre saw. ##that, "There is a mixture of impatienc. e and nervousness in the brushstrokes that almost makes us. ##forget his usual dexterity, which, indeed. , he seems to disavow or reject, as if his gift were of n. ##o use to him at this time...."424 Picasso i. n fact no longer required “dexterity.” Instead, he was. ##seemingly at the mercy of a pure force of wil. l that exudes the sense of being driven by factors ot. ##her than talent. When taken altogether as a ser. ies that is examined here from work to work, the ap. ##parent shifts in style and the mastery of his han. d do not negate our understanding of the matrix f. ##irst established in the earliest of the paintings f. rom July 22. That the horse and bull become mor. ##e abstracted, less physical or mortal, or by August o. f 1934 are dispersed in a new style of wildne. ##ss, the language of these battles was not lost in Picas. so’s temperamental changes which carried wi. ##th symbolic form.
As for la femme torero in the July 27 C. ourses de taureaux, Marie-Thérèse is reco. ##gnizable by the voluminous arc of a sweeping violet muleta. or cape, violet being one of Picasso’s f. ##avorite negative colors connoting the conflated terms the, “. ’violet of violence,’ the ‘violent vio. ##let of [Death’s] claws,’ and his own ‘sham violet cut[ting] th. e throat of the window’ of fate,”425. ##acutely recognized by Gasman. As is known, violet was the signa. ture color ascribed to “M-T,” in t. ##he masterpiece portraits beginning in 1931. But unlike the

traditional red muleta that incites th. e bull to charge, the violet c. ##ape was neutral in that sense. It is one of the crescent motifs in the. painting, its large arc not. ##only a feminizing principle, but an enclosure under which she is closel. y included in the fight. Ma. ##rie-Thèrése’s presence in the arena was iconoclastic. She literally invad. es the terreno of the bul. ##lring that determines pisar el terreno del toro, that is, the bull’s terrai. n,426 which is used to. ##designate the work of the man and to provoke the charge. The bull knows the r. ing well and will oft. ##en pick a point in which he will defy his adversary to enter. He will leave thi. s spot only to char. ##ge the man, or in this case, the horse, and then will return back to it. As a gen. eral rule, the ma. ##tador should not put himself in this instance, facing this spot, but rather to be o. n the dividing. ##line of the two places. The bull will always try to stay inside this point, as if it. were a dividin. ##g line between life and death.427 Yet, Picasso, drawing upon his deep knowledge of the. bullfight, r. ##epeatedly gives us the moment at which that line has been violated or crossed and the b. ull in a st. ##ate of revoltoso, or rapidly charging, incurs death as the imminent result.
Marie-Thèrése. is again. ##both witness and point of strength against the inconclusive dualism that Picasso battles t. hrough i. ##n the allegory. She will remain in the pictures up to September 9, 1934, in her station at t. he bac. ##k and right of the bull. In that she is represented otherwise by a triangle with three black d. ots. ##(eyes and mouth) for the head, and in some instances, a decorative skirt and violet stockings in. th. ##e exuberant August 1 rendition (fig. 42); her placement by the cipher of darkness is coordinate t. o. ##the fourth figure, a small white winged-figure.

overlooked in the critical literature on the subject, is. ##a p. re-Guernican element of light that by 1935 will be proven to exemplify a substitute sun.
This. ##very s. mall figure is composed in three geometric parts of a sphere embedded into a crescent and a. ##triangle. that do not differ except in terms of palette and faktur throughout the campaign. In the m. ##orphology. of the character, the simple shapes take on the obvious characteristics of head, wings, a. ##nd body; a. nd, the four black dots in the triangle sexualize the figure by identification of the fo. ##urth lower d. ot as the mons Venus, which is also found in the corps of bathers from September 1932. ##(figs. 44-46),. most evident in the girl on the right in Baigneuse au bord de la mer (fig. 47). More. ##significantly,. the angel is a construction of alchemical symbols that refer to the sun, represente. ##d by the circle. that rises and falls in each of the seven works in relation to the the moon, symbol. ##ized by the cresc. ent;428 and, the triangle “grounds” the angel by its connotation of the element o. ##f fire. The angel i. s a figure of the sol y sombra, the prerequisite of the ritual passing of the s. ##un over the arena. Si. gnifying the sun and its shadow, and levitating between brightness and shroud. ##ed darkness, this is th. e penultimate figure of ontological ambivalence in the campaign.

is then that our angel of th. ##e corrida is a dark-and-light character, a. cosmological figure that traverses alchemical and Christ. ##ian symbolism. As the combined sun-and-moon. we return to the “moon crescent” 430 face of the girl i. ##n the mirror of Jeune fille devant un miroir. , Marie- Thèrése, 1932 (fig. 33), which inspired “Pica. ##sso’s astrological mirrors of the sun and the. moon in his writings.”431 This implies that the moon-. ##like crescent wings of the angel-figure were de. rived from and refer to various mythologies, belief. ##s, and superstitions that are specifically undefi. ned but may include female warriors whose “moon-s. ##haped” instruments include the crescent sickle or s. cythe of Death; the bow of slaughter used by Ar. ##temis against the Niobids set as an astrological map. of stars in the night sky; or, the sacrificial. ##role of the Mesopotamian moon god’s sacrifice of bull. s found in the crescents of Early Dynastic s. ##eals, the various crescent shaped bull’s horns testimony. to the astral crescent, must not be overlo. ##oked in Picasso’s totalizing intentions.
In certain repre. sentations of the Virgin Mary she stands. ##in splendor upon an inverted moon, a symbol of her fertilit. y through its waxing and waning. The mo. ##on also served to highlight cosmic events, divine epiphanies,. and the ephemeral nature of life, the. ##mysterium lunae. By around 1348, a type of Marian iconography. known as Mondsichelmadonna, of the M. ##adonna standing withinin the crescent moon referred to the Apok. alyptische Frau, or The “Virgin of. ##the Apocalypse,”432 as described in Revelations 12:1, “...a woman. clothed with the sun, with the mo. ##on under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;"

whereas, the. crescent under Mary’s fe. ##et of the Assumption signifies her victory over time and space.433
Picasso’s. strategic expression,. ##the symbolic positioning of the corrida angel between the horse on the viewer. ’s left, and Marie-Th. ##èrése-matador on the right anchored by the dark mass of the bull, was resolute.. Despite the increas. ##ing fluidity and animated if not agitated line in the serial works, the winged f. igure, like that o. ##f the horse, bull, and Marie- Thèrése was maintained in its original placement in. the battles. In c. ##ontext, the winged- figure may serve to mediate the conflict, despite favoring the. side of the hors. ##e, “angel” from the Greek angelos, being one who announces or tells, a messenger or. guide which in. ##Pauline doctrine recognized them as, “principalities and powers” just below the Godhe. ad in their a. ##uthority (Colossians 1:16).
In Walter Benjamin’s extended analysis of Paul Klee’s water. color, Ange. ##lus Novus, 1920, whose great forebear was Albrecht Dürer’s angel in Melancolia, the angel. took the. ##form of a dialectical enquiry in the philosopher’s metaphysical-theological concerns. In 1. 933, his. ##interpretation of the function of the angel expanded from being a solicitous spirit to a Lu. ciferi. ##an being, a dark giver of light that contained, “satanic features with a half-repressed smile”. and. ##had satanic-like “claws” and “sharp wings.”434 During Benjamin’s refuge from the numbing terror. of. ##Nazi Germany, he again changed the “meaning” of the angel from reflecting personal proclivities. and. ##being his angel, to becoming the universalized Angel of History. In brief, Benjamin’s closing an. a. ##lysis, written in 1940, poetically described Angelus’s tragedy: Its wings were caught in severe sto.. ##rm winds “with such a violence that the angel can no longer close them,” the metaphor being the fut. ##u. re of humankind, or in Benjamin’s

estimation, “what we call progress.”435 In the context of the mass extermin. ##ations. and other war atrocities, the “storm winds” were the increasingly specific catastrophes of a. ##nnihilat. ion that made it impossible for the angel to take flight and ascended heavenward. At this. ##point Benj. amin’s last entry turned toward the Messianic, the core miracle by which he believed the. ##world might. have been saved.
Despite concentrating upon the corrida seraphim, the figure of the ho. ##rse enhances. our understanding of light according to Picasso. Given that the horse was granted cont. ##rol of the swo. rd this occurred in tandem with the presence of the seraphim in the arena on July 27. ##. It was only wi. th the earlier depictions from July 22 and 24 that the bull was seen in the attack. ##ing and killing po. sition. Now reversed, which we see in the Phillips, Paris, St. Louis, Philadelph. ##ia and Ann Arbor pai. ntings the horse is empowered to potentially obliterate the darkness by killin. ##g the bull. The diagon. al spear becomes a major compositional element in all of these works, coming. ##from the left and trave. rsing the middle of the pictures, directed as it is, directly into the mas. ##s of the bull which is alw. ays at the center or center right of each work. We note that the horse i. ##s no longer on the ground, s. ubmissively beat down and devoured; but now, stands rearing its front. ##legs during the attacks and is. overarched if the bull is dying or has been killed.
In the four canv. ##ases painted on July 27, August. 1, 2, and 3 the horse is serpentine, its incurvate neck and rounded. ##front legs are a veritable figu. re “S’ and the tails are highly animated that is especially clear. ##in the St. Louis picture (fig. 49). . That the horse is now also a type of serpent increases an apoc. ##alyptic reading of the Courses de ta. ureaux, “For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in. ##their tails, for their tails are like. serpents with heads, and

by. ##means of them they wound..,” Revelations. 9: 19. As a hyperextended “S” the horse’s wildness equate. ##s it with the serpent-dragon of the Apocal. ypse and by that to the “woman clothed with the sun, wit. ##h the moon under her feet....” (Revelations. 12: 1). An angel is also coupled with the serpent, and. ##in this form brings expression through sacred. and alchemical lore of the serpent, a symbol of the M. ##ercurial elixir of the crucified Christ of Joh. n 3:14, therefore, the One who heals the world. In a. ##nother Biblical sense, serpents and seraphim wer. e regarded as being interchangeable beings mention. ##ed six times in Isaiah 6: 2-6, five of the verses. refer to serpents and the single verse to an ange. ##l. In the 11th century Bamberg Apocalypse manuscrip. t, a page illustrating “Angel and the Serpent,”. ##(fig. 50) presented the hierarchical beings imbued w. ith specific powers of light and darkness. Al. ##though the seven seraphim presented in Picasso’s Course. de taureaux may seem, in the darkest manife. ##stations to suggest the seven angels of the Apocalypse (. Rev. 2:1), we note that according to Bibli. ##cal “assignment,” first, the messenger-angels are rulers.. They are described in a double manner by. ##a name that expresses subordination, and by a figure which. expresses authority, “He that is greates. ##t among you, let him be your servant,” Matthew 23:11.
Picass. o’s need for light brought into the da. ##rkness by Marie-Thèrése was recon- sidered in Femme à la bougi. e, combat entre taureau et cheval, W. ##inter 1933-34, in which the archangel Gabriel kneels, perhaps in. supplication before the ritual bat. ##tle, and holds a candle close to the embroiled and writhing horse. and bull (fig. 51). This scene of. ##an angel, bull, and horse will establish the triadic relationship. that evolves in the paintings fr. ##om July through September. In the September 8th etching, La grande. corrida, avec femme torero, in w. ##hich Marie-Thèrése appears for the last time (fig. 52), the triangle. of the seraphim no longer cont. ##ains its gendered four black dots which have disappeared altogether.. Despite the figure being diffi. ##cult to analyze in the complex sheet, we find tiny sketches of sexual,. 275

cosmological, and m. ##etaphysical talismans drawn in the form of two solar eyes, the coil of. the universe, a crudely real. ##ized vulva, and a phallus sketched into the small quarters of the triang. ular body-shape. It contai. ##ned a small universe of personal epigraphs that were far more individualiz. ed for this seraph than. ##in treatments that Picasso had given to all other versions, noticeable in th. e seven thumbnails fro. ##m each work of art illustrated here (figs. 55- 61).
In the last of the 1934 Co. urses de taureaux in. ##which geometricized seraphim were depicted, Picasso’s style was carnivalesque a. nd crazed (figs. 5. ##3 and 54). The exploded scene of the Philadelphia canvas was made of long dashes e. mitted from undi. ##stinguished shapes in which we virtually lose the bull and Marie-Thèrése who has by. now acquired th. ##e attribute of the crescent-moon for her small head, which is embedded in the chaos.. What would be. ##the golden sunlight of the arena was over-painted with blue lines of horse legs, a bur. st on the bu. ##ll’s back by impact of the spear, and splotches of color taken to be blood and mud. The. angel maint. ##ained her position on the diagonal black line of the vara, or spear and hovered routinely. above the. ##horse. Her head was a red ball and the wings were outlined in red; the triangular skirt,. therefore. ##her body, was transparent like that of the horse’s head, and seemingly floated away as if. disengag. ##ed from its source. From September 9, 1934 to April 25, 1935 Picasso did not work on the the. me of. ##the corrida or depict other courses de taureaux. But the problem of light had not been resolve. d by. ##the seraphim; and, as if it had somehow plagued him in the months that had lapsed they reappear. ed. ##in three works, a single graphite drawing and two exceptional, highly-colored works on paper from.. ##April 26 and 27 (figs. 62- 66).

downward facing heads, and, what had been triangular bodies were now compact layers. ##of. short horizontal lines. Both components were attached to a crescent-moon as “wings” of the serap. ##h t. hat remained the same, turned upward. The sphere, or head was seen in three versions with diffe. ##ring. interior areas: four dots in the graphite drawing; as a soft green orb; and, heavily filled wi. ##th bla. ck ink making it the darkest of what would be “filament” inside the angelic bulb-shaped figu. ##re. As f. or the lines above the crescents these were threadings on the metal bases of what were in. ##effect “se. raphim-light bulbs.” Seraphim being derived from the Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, and respe. ##ctively, und. erstood to be “the burning ones” was made Luciferian in the technological corridas noc. ##turnas.
In Mex. ico City in 1887 a report dispatched that, “Colon Plaza was filled almost to suffoca. ##tion last night. to witness first attempt at a bull fight by electric light. The electric lights flo. ##oded the arena.... .”436 Andalusian and other Spanish plaza de toros also began to feature night cor. ##ridas. The ll:00 p.. m. bullfights commenced in what would otherwise at that hour have been the dark. ##ness of small village. s. However, making good use of well- illuminated rural plazas strung with lin. ##es of bare light bulbs. during ferias, local entrepreneurs promoted nighttime bullfights. In various. ##studies of the psychoso. cial dimension of the electric corridas it was concluded that aficionados. ##panned the events. Those w. ho were interviewed for the study reported that the specific artificiali. ##ty of electric light kept th. e bulls from performing well, that they required the sun, and, that th. ##e severity of the overhead lig. hts, unlike the sun stunned and blinded the bulls into submission. I. ##t was the opinion that confronta. tion, which is at the heart of any good bullfight, could not occur. ##. Essentially, the night corridas. were not true corridas. They were regarded as entertainment, call. ##ed la charlotadas, named for Charli. e Chaplin, “La Charlot,” the comic. In the most scathing

con. ##demnation of the night bullfights, the. historian Lozano Rey wrote, “...if the inventiveness of the. ##impresarios has created noctural corrid. as, it is certain that it is nothing to do with serious cor. ##ridas, but rather, when not repugnant pan. tomimes with grotesque events, which are attended not by. ##the true lovers of corridas, but only by th. e lower levels of the afición.”437
And so within the do. ##main of Picasso’s beloved Spanish bullfight,. he endowed the arena with heretical substitutions of t. ##he sun, the “seraphim-light bulbs,” that reint. roduced the equation of incandescence and malevolenc. ##e. Federico Garcià Lorca had defined "Spanish" s. un as that that could only be understood by the Sp. ##aniard; and, under its aurelian blaze timeless rit. uals of death and sacrifice occurred. Lorca wrot. ##e that the Spanish “illuminated the dead who in the. old rituals were brought out into the glare [of. ##the sun] where their bodies were celebrated in the l. ight [and], their profile is as sharp as the. ##cutting edge of a barber's knife.”438 This would also d. escribe death in the bullring, but not by e. ##lectric light.
Yet, if Picasso’s work had not shed any cl. ues about his investment in the symbolism. ##of the electric, a torrent of writing that commenced on Ap. ril 18, one week prior to the incarnati. ##on of the seraphim-light bulbs, in unpunctuated blocks of idi. osyncratic French and the maternal Sp. ##anish of his childhood included the words eléctricas, l’électri. que, d’ampoules électriques, and, b. ##ombillas eléctricas in over thirty entries.

Guernica and the. Conflict of Radiance Part One: Candles of War
Wher. ##e else will you take the bird Than into the flame. ?
Novalis
Resuming the scrutiny of Guernica, with. ##an appreciation of the electric sun vis-à-vis the. paradigm of the electric seraphim; and, the uniq. ##ue configurations of the degraded and black suns dep. icted in the 1930s requires the need to study. ##the third light in the painting, that of the candle. W. hereas the focus upon the essence of incande. ##scent light and representations of the light bulb has ma. rginalized a consideration of the candle i. ##n Guernica up to this point, it is the persistent radiance. of the pre-modern era, handmade, lit, an. ##d tended by hand that is the apparent counterforce, equal i. n scale and articulation, to that of th. ##e profane sun and indisputable for its importance. The candle. , unlike the sun450 was instantly amo. ##ng the first elements that Picasso drew in the May 1st and 2nd. sketches that recorded his instinctu. ##al, irate reaction to the aerial bombings of Gernika (fig. 55, p. . 70 and figs. 1-3 of this chapter. ##).
There is significance in identifying the scribbled expressions. of the early sketches as the ligh. ##t of a candle and not an oil lamp.

have been occluded, or left undiscl. osed in the darkness, Pi. ##casso set a conundrum in play via the tri-partite figures of light, the sun,. the light bulb, and th. ##e candle.
Does he suggest that light, as the Platonic Good, is impossible in. the warring twentieth. ##century? In Dante’s exclamation, “The Good is the cause of knowledge, of truth. itself, and is of st. ##ill higher worth than both of these. Just as light and vision are like the sun. but not identical to. ##it, so knowledge and truth are like the Good, different from and lower than it.. There are thus two. ##powers, the Good which reigns over the intelligible world and the sun which rule. s over the visibl. ##e world.”451 Is there a measure of balance against force between the three lights i. n Guernica, “fo. ##rce” being a metaphorical expansion of the plight of the innocents in the path of fas. cism? Is the. ##work of allegory a blinding, that is, does it relieve the inability to see in mimetic t. erms that t. ##hat was otherwise unbearable or un- seeable? As Jacques Derrida conceded to Borges’s opin. ion on th. ##e metaphoric vastness of light, the French philosopher exclaimed, “Borges is correct, ‘Perh. aps uni. ##versal history is but the history of several metaphors.’ Light is only one example of these s. evera. ##l, but what an example! Who will ever dominate it, who will ever renounce its meaning without f. irs. ##t being pronounced by it? What language will ever escape it?”452
This thesis has presented the sp. o. ##radic but purposeful trajectory of the symbolic light bulb in the context of malevolence, building.. ##toward the paragon of the electric sun. Picasso countered the potentially all-encompassing power and. ##. panoptical machinery of the electric beacon by coupling it with a simple candle thrust into the sc. ##e. ne of destruction by a candle- bearer, ancient spirit of Truth and the feminizing principle of li. ##ght. (fig. 4). In direct interface the two forms of light, taken that the electric sun is considered. ##as. one, the candle is

exactingly placed at the r. ##ight-han. d edge of the sun’s rays. To reiterate a portion of this observation stated earlier, the s. ##tance of d. istancing is especially poignant in the affirmative thrust of the candle bearer whose la. ##mp stops jus. t short of the extra long tip of the sun’s spiked rays.453 The stance of distancing is. ##especially po. ignant in that the candle-bearer is an archaic figure of truth, therefore clarity, a. ##nd, of innocence. that stands as a reminder of those qualities and does so in the failed technologic. ##al ambience of th. e scene. The candle holder itself is a common nineteenth century object whose var. ##iety with a glass c. himney ensured that the flame would not be easily extinguished and would also b. ##urn brighter and long. er. The interior space of the glass chimney, like that of the light bulb, rev. ##eals the simple outline. of the light’s energy source, the wick and flame, opposed to the tungsten f. ##ilament. In studies from. May 2 and 9, candleholders similar to the one in Guernica, as well as the. ##figuration of the candle-. bearer resolved to the degree that the arm and head represent the whole f. ##igure, will not change. The. candle, which was the only source of light in the early drawings, is he. ##ld over the bull and the col. lapsed horse in the foreground. The candle will not become an essentia. ##l factor in the lighting of th. e impaled horse in Guernica whose expression of anguish was intensif. ##ied by the composited electric l. ight.
A brief excursus on the earliest depictions of candlelight,. ##or interior lighting, in Picasso’s. work has bearing upon the later dispositions of it in light’s va. ##rying capacities in his work. Nothi. ng less than a profound sensitivity about the allegorical bread. ##th of radiance was achieved from 1895. to the early autumn of 1900, prior to Picasso’s departure for. ##Paris in which his sense of room ligh. t would change dramatically in the incanescent halls of the. ##Can- Can and renowned Moulin de la Galet. te. The art of pictorial illumination had been instructed. ##to Picasso by his father, the academic pai. nter and teacher, José Ruiz Blasco; and, by 1897, 453 Ch. ##apter Two, “Illuminating War: Black Sun, Ele. ctric Sun.”

further taught at the Academia R. ##eal de San Fernando in Madrid, which included. the study and copying of paintings by Velázquez, Goya. ##, and El Greco, among other masters in the Prad. o. In addition to the immense lineage of European m. ##asterpieces that the young Picasso was schooled i. n, he would have been aware of a popular subgenre. ##of Spanish painting known as the tradition of luz. de gaz454 that enjoyed a long reputation from 18. ##80-1930. This was a veritable genre of softly lit, n. on-descript domestic interiors with families o. ##r an individual in salon or dining room settings. The. proliferation of this type of painting, favor. ##ed in middle-class Spanish households, could not have b. een missed by Picasso and in some cases may. ##have been lauded by his father since many of the practit. ioners were well- respected academic arti. ##sts.
The candles of war, 1937-1945, come forward as artifac. ts of the sensibility found in the Barc. ##elona period of Picasso’s “Catholic” juvenilia, beginning in. 1895, and his further development in M. ##adrid. His potential with the art of painting was already prov. ing Picasso to be a prodigy that was. ##first realized in the astonishing accomplishment of La premiere. communion, 1895-96, painted when h. ##e was fifteen years old (fig. 5). In the scene, two of four candl. es are snuffed out and left to sm. ##oke in the dark regions of the church altar, making the subject of. the picture not only about the H. ##oly Sacrament, but also one of death. As John Richardson wrote of th. e candlelight in the painting,. ##“Tempting as it is to see these candles as a reference to Pablo’s gut. tering faith.... The candles. ##could stand for the two living and two dead [Ruiz] children. Combined w. ith the rose petals, emble. ##ms of mortality, that are scattered on the altar steps, this device would. suggest that this First C. ##ommunion is also a vanitas – a

The agency of. light and i. ##ts effects appeared in a small group of sick room and
deathbed pictures made in the wint. er of 1899. ##-1900 that have never been considered as
sensible precursors to Picasso’s mature sensitivi. ty to li. ##ght as allegory. Certainly his rousing
depiction of ecstatic candlelight that illuminates th. e prof. ##ile of the deceased Carlos
Casagemas (1901)456 is outstanding for its importance in the overal. l ta. ##xonomy of Picasso’s
light. There is a symbolic relationship to it found in earlier pictures in w. hi. ##ch an innate
sensibility about light was rendered in a few morbid late nineteenth century works. T.. ##hese
unveiled Picasso’s hand regarding an initial ability to combine pathos with illumination. The
c. ##. harcoal drawing on fragmented paper, Prêtre qui visite un homme mourante, late 1899 (fig. 7) is a. ##sc. ene of last rites, the viaticum, Latin for “provisions for a journey” in which light is
traditio. ##nall. y seen as an expression of the mortal condition. The faintly applied white chalk
of the glass. ##lampsh. ade may have been an indication of the passing of life in the otherwise
monotone work on pap. ##er. Has. Picasso, this early in his burgeoning genius presented the
viewer with the suggestion of a. ##situation. that is either/or? In other words, does light stand
as a witness and as a symbol of prima. ##l life for. ce in its role to illuminate? Is the essence of
light, as lux, expressed as subjective a. ##nd interior. states of mind,457 of enlightenment or being
enlightened, of the imagination and dreams. ##that gave ri. se to metaphors on existence already
a factor in creating a subjective vocabulary of. ##light?

In the hushed atmosphere of the small oil painting, Au l. ##it de morte (fig. 8) th. e deathbed scene is painted in greys redolent of the tones of Crucifixion a. ##nd Deposition scenes that. Picasso had learned from at the Prado. The ambiguous bedside light, eithe. ##r a candle or a small lamp. , is the brightest point in the room. Its radiance reaches softly throug. ##hout the scene and across th. e table’s surface in a glow that is otherwise a horizontal line. In th. ##e third example, Au chevet de. la femme mourante, (fig. 9) here, the lamp has gone cold and dark. Gr. ##isaille reached its purpose, an. d only through the window beyond the dying woman’s bed does the lig. ##ht of day—for Picasso will often. provide a door or window as the “outside” possibility of the conta. ##inment of tragedy, as he did in Th. e Three Dancers, 1923— offered in faded greens and yellows appea. ##r in an otherwise colorless room. Th. e precedents established in these humble early works that brou. ##ght the proximity of light into the pr. esence of death, are upheld to be compelling prototypes for. ##Picasso’s sense of radiance leading up t. o the Great War, and in individual examples and campaigns. ##created in the context of the Spanish Civi. l War, World War II, and the aftermath of those near inc. ##omprehensible catastrophes.
As with the ligh. t bulb, whose manifestation as “Filament-Harlequin” in. ##1914 was absent thereafter until the conflict. of the civil war in Spain gave cause for its recurre. ##nce, the candle was also nonexistent in Picasso. ’s interwar works of art. It reappeared without pre. ##cedent as an attribute of Marie-Thèrése in her ro. le as the bearer of candle light formulated in Fe. ##mme à la bougie, combat entre le teaureau et le che. val from July 24, 1934.458 On April 28, 1935, t. ##he day after the final seraphim-light bulbs were impl. anted in scenes of the corrida, Picasso took. ##up working on the seventh and final state of the master. ful etching, Minotauromachy (fig. 10).

mazda, a. ##unique supernatural and electrical figure in the seraphim-. light bulb eventually magnified into th. ##e irrepressible electric sun, was nevertheless not continued,. but was replaced, so to speak, with a. ##ttention now on the light of the candle. Throughout the stages. of the Minotauromachy, a koré459 fig. ##ure, typified by the stance in profile of Marie-Thèrése, holds. out a candle. She famously confronts. ##a gigantic but rather diffident Minotaur now seemingly more bli. nd than ever460 that extends his r. ##ight arm as if sensing or feeling the light as a haptic essence, w. hich otherwise seems to be blind. ##ing him even further. Picasso, taken as the grand Minotaur, holds hi. s left hand near his heart in. ##a gesture of protection against or perhaps in trust of the girl whom h. e knows so well.
Varied crit. ##ical explanations of the candlebearer, being careful not to associate th. e figure with the Light-be. ##arer, L. for Lucifer meaning, “light bringing” have been suggested to repr. esent many things, noted. ##by many scholars. Unlike Marie-Thèrése, the female candlebearer in Guernica. is articulated with kn. ##ife-like fingernails and breast nipples typical of the “Dora Maar’s” in the ‘. 30s. The gentler figu. ##re was widely interpreted for her role as a "supernatural being, a modern repre. sentation of an Eri. ##nye or a fury;"461 or in other instances, "the Republic, in the attitude of a fem. ale warrior: she. ##rushes the Nationalist horse;"462 and, "the big female head, which, as in a Greek t. ragedy, appears. ##to be a tragic mask. . .

Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, And her salvation like a torch that is. ##burning.. "464
Inasmuch as the Mithraic tauroctony was integral to the symbolic constitution of Cruc. ##ifixion, 1. 930, its potential application to the mythical infrastructure of Guernica may have inclu. ##ded the lore. of two torchbearers known from dedicatory inscriptions as “Cautes” and “Cautopates.” I. ##n the iconogr. aphy of a tomb painting at Via Flaminia each winged figure carries a torch, the one p. ##ointed up, the. other down. Cautes, whose torch flamed upwards, has typically been associated with t. ##he primary symbo. lism of the Mithraic bull.465 The tauroctony appears "to represent the astronomica. ##l situation, which. was obtained when the equinoxes were in Taurus and Scorpius"466 Furthermore, the. ##connection of the. torchbearers to these opposing astrological signs suggests that they signify the. ##spring and autumn e. quinoxes. If we consider the various renditions of Picasso's bearer of candlel. ##ight as an image of ho. pe, moreover as an illuminator of the tragic, which ensures the renewal of l. ##ife through sacrifice, t. hen the Mithraic Cautes may be added to the corpus of extent hermeneutical. ##readings. As the represen. tation of the spring equinox, Cautes's torch ushers in the rising sun fo. ##rcing life to begin its incr. ease. The torches are pointed north and south,

As we understand. the Minotauromachy for its essential conceptual import. ##ance to Guernica, the source for the figure of. the candlebearer also finds resonance with the seven. ##teenth century French painter, Georges de La To. ur’s candle light nocturnes.

In the war years of actual carnage being the subject of t. he “meal,” and the artifacts. ##of slaughter left for investigation under electric light, the tables fr. om this period were staged. ##to present the evil against flesh that was perpetrated by war. The indeli. ble symbolism of these s. ##till lifes would never escape Picasso’s conscience. Twenty years later, Coq. sur une chaise sous la. ##lampe, 1962, (fig. 14) painted when the artist was eighty-one, is a large-sca. le canvas of a rooste. ##r with bound and raised legs that repeat the figuration of the main victim in T. he Charnel House, 1. ##945, who mirrored the indignity of the inverted crucified Saint Peter, symbolized. through the grisa. ##ille coq.473

A. ##s Fra. ncois Gilot retold an account of the day, Picasso had insisted upon going to see Zurburán’s S. ##t.

In the combination of candle, sun, and bull the pain. ##ting was a continuation of Picasso’s undying i. re and is nothing less than a testimony of the slaug. ##hter that had increased since Guernica premiered. in 1937. The still life, along with others that sh. ##are the same temperament exemplifies Picasso’s co. ncept of nada, rife in the “illogical” writings f. ##rom 1935; a “nothingness” equated in the later writ. ings of July of ‘40 in the “Corrida of Mourning. ##.” Through Picasso’s words, Gasman discerned the “’as. tonished eye of the bull’ named the “nada,” a. ##“routine abbreviation” for what he called his ‘philoso. phie merdeuse,’489 [the escatological merde. ##of the period, a “shitty philosophy”] a melange of disbe. lief and metaphysical disgust.”490 Nature. ##morte avec bougie, like Guernica, and most of the war-time. works included the two main elements of. ##Picasso’s symbolic warfare repertoire: light and darkness.. Perhaps Picasso’s ‘nada’ exceedingly ma. ##gnified Goya’s sense of Nada – Ello dira (Nothing – It Speaks. for Itself), 1814-15, etching plate 6. ##9 of Los Disastros. Goya’s Nothing has been linked to his skep. tical mindset and public outcry agai. ##nst Spanish absolutism that brought on the horrors of war. If Pi. casso and Goya share a universaliz. ##ed nihilism, it may be summarized in Goya’s words: “You have made. the journey to eternity and found. ##nothing there.”491 And yet, both Spanish masters will rely on the. deep tradition of sacred light t. ##o vanquish the shadows. Four years following Nada, the light in Cris. to en el Monte de los Olivos,4. ##92 1819 is cast from the heavens.

In ancient Basque mythology, the sun i. ##s known as Eki,. Eguzki and other variations in the Euzkadi language. Sun is regarded as the daughte. ##r of Mother Earth. to whom she returns daily. Deemed the protector of humanity, she was not unlike t. ##he sun in other so. lar mythologiess whose female deities were adversaries of all evil spirits, incl. ##uding the Aboriginal. Wala, Celtic Brigid, Chinese Xihe, Egyptian Hathor, Japanese Shinto Amaterasu,. ##Navajo Ahsonnutli, a. mong many others traditions. The ancient Basque peoples regarded their sun as. ##“grandmother” and they. held rites in her honor at sunset. In order to rejuvenate the light, Ekhi t. ##raveled to Itxasgorrieta. , or, “The Red Seas,” beneath the earth and into the womb of her mother, L. ##urbira.
Picasso’s formulat. ions of the suns in Guernica, taken alongside representations of the sun. ##vis-a-vis Mithraic and Chri. stian mythoi in previous works, took no account of the solar pantheism. ##of the Basques. Yet, being an. inherently Spanish sun in its first phase at state two

it was an agrari. ##an symbol of the folk. Unlike the bull, horse, cr. ying women, the dead baby, fallen soldier, and th. ##e candlebearer, the sun did not appear in any prepa. ratory sketches, finished drawings, or notebook. ##entries. The paucity of any evidence that it would b. e anything less than a feature, which Picasso. ##must have inherently understood was, in reality, an un. resolved element, which he worked through i. ##n four different versions.
When the unforetold figuration. of a light bulb was placed into the unfin. ##ished eye- shape of state seven, the final stage of the pa. inting, the electric light of war was in. ##stantly turned “on” in the tableau. The solarizing effect of. such light was not cast with evenness,. ##but rather, the overexposure of whiteness was spread in disr. uptive passages of cubistic disharmon. ##y that was otherwise a masterful arrangement of parts. At twent. y-seven feet wide, Guernica is inst. ##antly visually explosive and every element claims a priority on t. he viewer’s attention. In this re. ##spect, the abundant areas of light that work through the compositio. n with organizational aplomb fu. ##nction like spotlights that momentarily blind. Yet, according to Pica. sso’s intention we must compr. ##ehend the painting as a whole to ensure its ever-present action, that i. s, if Guernica is to have i. ##mportance in perpetuity as an anti-war decree.
The ambiguity of the elect. ric sun has been the caus. ##e of much discussion over the years, and it has drawn a wide range of diffe. ring responses by many. ##well-respected authorities. That its legacy is founded in the seraphim-light. bulbs of the corridas. ##that figure so discreetly, but nevertheless prominently, as precursors to the. hovering electric sun. ##introduces a new theoretical possibility that broadens the sun’s complexity. A. s a witness, illumi. ##nator, protector, and profane god-eye over the agonizing figures in Guernica the. symbol has remaine. ##d in debate. Despite the well-grounded stance drawn from the iconography of incand. escent lighting. ##in Picasso’s oeuvre, presented in this thesis, other interpretations of the
324
324. sun have not de. ##lved so deeply into its precedents. The following four authors, chosen among several. , offered the. ##following points of view:
Picasso’s view of the rape of Guernica,..is staged finally a. t night, und. ##er a sun which is very like an electric ceiling fixture...the sun is heaped all at once. with its tr. ##unkful of alternate roles, a sun, a pupiled eye, a shaded lamp, a crown of thorns. Insofa. r as the. ##bulb defines the shape at the same time as something suggesting a shaded newspaper-office c. eiling. ##light....498
Frank D. Russell
...he filled in the last remaining unpainted surface...by outli. ning. ##the jagged rays of the sun in black....and carefully drew a light bulb complete with filament w. ith. ##in the ellipse of the sun....behind the sun (or the electric light, whose brightness and location. s. ##uggest an outdoor lamp or streetlight)...the illumination is both sun and indoor light....499
Hers.. ##chell B. Chipp
...one may mention the duplication of the theme of the light source, which
splits up.. ##in the modest oil lamp, thrust passionately by the woman of
Guernica, and the large, inert, mechani. ##c. al luminary at the ceiling.500 Rudolf Arnheim
His latest, and final, decision was to transform th. ##e o. val sun into the shade of a suspended lamp, underneath which he sketched the light bulb, sealin. ##g in. the process the final ambiguity of whether the scene took place indoors or out.501

From Dora Maar’s historic and vital photographs the critical st. ##ages in his. process of painting-as-thinking were captured.

The animated petaline. rays, evocative of the tournesol,. ##a single sunflower “turning toward the sun,” was heliotropic in it. s expression of nationalism, str. ##ength, and growth despite the strange, wrecked landscape over which. it beamed. The raised forearm o. ##f the fallen soldier divided the radius of the effulgent disc through. its center, acting as a verti. ##cal support for the pyramidal composition. Without relinquishing his w. ill the fallen soldier or wo. ##rker, taken for dead, nevertheless tightly clenches a shaft of wheat or. branches of greenery that e. ##cho the living energy of the sun’s rays. At this point in Picasso’s decis. ions for the elements of. ##the painting, the inclusion of the Republican salute irrefutably defined Gu. ernica as a political w. ##ork of art, as an anti-fascist proclamation rather than the universal anti-wa. r statement that it c. ##ame to be.

architectural friezes throughout the country, and since 1870, the f. ac. ##e of the peseta, Hispania was represented holding her arm aloft while grasping a laurel branch or. c. ##orona of foliage. In various appearances she is warrior and worker (figs. 22 and 23).
Picasso estab.. ##lished the irreconcilable dualism of light and darkness through the positioning of the flowering su. ##n. over the white bull in state three. From the first gestures drawn in paint on the virgin canvas,. ##th. e bull almost filled the entire left half; or, in the least, the bull’s air of possession and st. ##aunc. hness looms with a menacing permanence. The animal is a figure whose height and girth encompas. ##ses te. rritory. From the top ridge of the neck across the unarticulated backbone and through the pl. ##ane of r. ibs and chest, the whole of which is the bull’s mass and an almost “negative” space in the. ##otherwise. compact composition. So broad is it that the large sun seemingly sets into the lower cur. ##vature of t. he hindquarters as if the lengthy spine were a distant ridge of the Spanish countryside. ##. Picasso is. insisting to show to himself, and in the company of Dora Maar, that at this point in h. ##is thinking th. e painting is a purely Spanish picture on the grandest scale.
The artifice of the se. ##tting sun into a. figure is an overlooked trait in Picasso’s work of the ‘30s. We have seen it in th. ##e way that the or. b of the seraphim-light bulbs settled into the triangular bodies of the angels. I. ##t occurs to me that. the orb and crescent, conflated as the figure of the seraphim, was not unlike G. ##iacometti’s sculptur. e, Suspended Ball, 1930, made of the same components, crescent and ball, a pen. ##ultimate example of th. e lure of Surrealism that Picasso’s figure of light may have tangentially be. ##en formed from. And cert. ainly, the cosmological components of the seraphim body type included the. ##crescent (Mercury or the M. oon) and the orb (Sun).
Considering the infusion of the sun into the fig. ##ure, we return to the Bather. s of 1932- 33, apropos of state two, in which the sun specifically set. ##s down into abstract baigneuse. s on

the beach. Notable in the symbolic conflation of the o. ##rb into black serpentine shapes,. in Femme étendue sur la plage, March 26, 1932, for example, this s. ##un is halfway set in to the recli. ning bather (fig. 24). The biomorphic dark form, a coordinated sh. ##adow with the geometric bather who. languidly props her right-angle arm up to support her triangular. ##head, is united with the orb-sun. T. hey have become one and in accord with the paradigm of the Fra. ##nco-soleil noir bathers, and granting. the relationship of the sun within the ritual of Mithraism, i. ##t is doubtful that Picasso truncated th. is essential characteristic for Guernica, although stated i. ##n different terms. We may equate the fine. art, geometry or a metaphysical combination of both found. ##in the tauromachy508 that is applicable t. o the baigneuses through Picasso’s control. By this line. ##of reasoning, the relationship of the sun-a. nd-bather and the sun-and-bull reifies an angling or “. ##setting into” that which is otherwise a foreig. n body: a form of possession.
A less than obvious co. ##nnection to this sun-and-figure relationship in. work from the ‘30s is found in Picasso’s pre-cubist. ##, Paysage, coucher de soleil, 1908 (fig. 25). In. the modest picture, the sun sets upon a hill in th. ##e humid atmosphere of late summer seen through par. ted boughs and reflected in the hazy pond. John. ##Richardson took note of the ’08 rue- des-Bois landsc. apes and commented on Picasso’s infusion of hi. ##mself into the short series of paintings: “Since he co. uld never depict anything without to some de. ##gree identifying with it, Picasso assumes the role of ge. nius loci in landscapes that constitute hi. ##s first sustained confrontation with nature.... as if he w. ere God reinventing the universe in his. ##image. ‘I want to see my branches grow that's why I started. to paint trees; yet I never paint them. ##from

nature. My tre. es are myself.’ [Picasso] completes t. ##he anthropomorphic process... banishing the figures and energiz. ing the trees as if they were so ma. ##ny self-portraits."509
In Picasso’s search to imbue the Guernica. sun with an appropriate signifier,. ##a substantial change occurred with the removal of the upright arm. devoid of fist and wheat or laur. ##el, and a sun that was no longer agrarian. Palau i Fabre claimed tw. o reasons for Picasso having do. ##ne that:
...he did not like the idea of revenge and because the lamen. t that Guernica makes is not. ##exactly the lament of the proletariat, but the lament of a people, the. Basque people, by way of a d. ##efenseless town that contains the symbol of their freedom. Neither did h. e introduce any specifical. ##ly Basque signifier. In Guernica, there are only victims of barbarism cryi. ng out of their pain. Th. ##is idea was to be central would impose itself completely. Otherwise, with th. e raised fist...the st. ##ruggle taking place in Spain was exclusively of the proletariat, and he knew t. hat it was not, that. ##it was also the struggle for democracy and the struggle of subject peoples...ag. ainst the centrali. ##st tyranny of the old Spain.510
The element that hangs in place of the flowering s. un in state two. ##is considered in state three to be the sun, although it lacks in recognition of sola. r characterist. ##ics (fig. 26). Picasso had taken the profound turn to imbue the painting with an ancie. nt device, a. ##winged- eye although lacking in pupil or iris. The faint sun’s soft rays from state two. remained a. ##s under painting for the new sun. Looking closely at what residual was left behind, the p. etals bec. ##ame “wings” around the top edge of the eye-shape. Picasso knowingly introduced an idiograph. ic or s. ##chematic Faravahar, the winged sun hieroglyph seen as a guardian angel in Zoroastrianism that. appea. ##rs on friezes and royal inscriptions as early as the Bronze Age, and was represented in variou. s fo. ##rms in the collection of antiquities in the Louvre. The eye must also be an apotropaic, the func. ti. ##on of which is to stare down evil from a higher form of

power. As Ahura Mazda,511 in its original form predating Islam, the “light” was meant as spiri. ##t. and wisdom. In other capacities, the sacred image of a winged-eye does not disallow its cosmogoni. ##cal. role in good and evil, the singular eye-in-profile would be associated with the Eye of Horus, a. ##nd t. he udjat. According to myth, Horus protected Re, the god of sun in a cosmic battle and in so d. ##oing h. e into a “great disc” and with “falcon wings,” that “flies up to the sun,”512 and destroys t. ##he enemy. . Hence-forth, the Egyptian sun was not only protective but also wrathful which has been d. ##iscussed w. ith regard to Mithras-Sol-Harlequin in Chapter Four, “Problems of an Elevated Conception. ##: The Sun, 1. 930-37.”
Throughout the next four stages of the painting the interior of the double-po. ##inted oval, or. winged-eye will remain blank. It was not articulated in any manner. Lacking commenta. ##ry from Picasso. or others who discussed the progress of the painting, we are bound to Maar’s photog. ##raphs in order t. o glean any possible clues about changes to the sun and the phases of its blanknes. ##s. From states thr. ee to six it was not an object of Picasso’s attention. Then dramatically he alte. ##red state three by t. he removal of the soft “winged” rays of light that he then fashioned as talons. ##extending around the. perimeter of whole sun, hence turning it into an explosive light (fig. 27). T. ##he sun’s rays were shar. pened akin to lancing tools of the picador, or the muletas of the toreros,. ##and were matched by the k. nife-like ears of the bull in a characteristic known by the aficionado as. ##astiagudo. This dramatic s. hift of the sun-and-bull was equaled by an increase in suffering seen i. ##n the speared horse. Up until. the fifth state the horse had been fairly indiscernible, but now more. ##clearly articulated directly. under the sun Picasso’s rendering of it ensured, visually, that its b. ##awl of agony fell in direct lin. e on diagonal with the bull’s left ear. Perhaps the horse was blind. ##ed by the sun or purely

b. y the pain from battle, as Erich Maria Remarque had lamented i. ##n All Quiet on the Western Front, “.... it is the vilest baseness to use horses in war. The cries th. ##at fill the air are worse than those of. men.... It is the martyred creation, wild with anguish, fil. ##led with terror, and groaning.”513
The a. uditory levels in Guernica, an odd prospect for a painting. ##is another matter that is altogether wort. hy of separate study. Nevertheless, the catalyst for the. ##implied cacophony of screaming women, the a. nxiously bleating bull, and tremulous neighing of the. ##horse in anguish was directly related to the S. tuka and incendiary bombings over Gernika. Although. ##there is no evidence of war in Guernica, no weap. ons, or shards of bombs throughout the compact vil. ##lage scene, the real aerial threat was inferred by. the upturned heads that defy the skies to oblite. ##rate the people. Despite the broad panoramic scope. of Guernica it was not a battle frieze. Cinemati. ##c in breadth, it affects the viewer as a freeze-fram. e moment of absolute terror when the victims w. ##ere in the present moment fleeing, dying, and crying f. or help. Here too, the large all-white bull. ##has transformed as a profile to the degree that its fron. tal features, including only one leg and h. ##oof, and the tail, significantly a rabicano white tail tha. t has snapped around at the far left of. ##the scene, are features of its entire body portrayed in stro. ng light. The remainder of the bull ha. ##s fallen into the darkness that pervades most of the left half. of Guernica. What is constant throug. ##h states one to ten is the position of the candle-bearer whose. arm does not waiver, diminish, or sh. ##ift in relation to the sun and the overall catastrophe that it a. ttempts to illuminate.
In effect,. ##the electric sun had exceeded all other expressions of the sun or. the light bulb in modernist progr. ##ams and other erstwhile contexts, including Bataille’s important ex. curses. It is singular and its. ##difference was borne from Picasso’s immense ingenuity that

spun the sun on axes. of varied metaphorical and s. ##tylistic inventions; and, converted the common light bulb as a sure emi. ssary of malevolence in its. ##transformation as a cipher. If the constancy of the leitmotif, the light. motive of the sun, persis. ##ted as a form of inversion, it also persisted as a form of indubitable sec. urity without which the. ##prevailing attacks upon it would have been negated in complete dark space, t. he cosmological negati. ##ve against which Picasso stormed. Then, in only one other work of significance. created after Guerni. ##ca and during the war was the sun depicted as an autograph of dualism, of the “. benefique ou malefi. ##que”514 essence of light that was not retired in the panoptical, apotropaic incan. descent sun.
In e. ##arly July of 1939 Picasso had returned to Antibes on the Riviera and was installed. in Man Ray’s apa. ##rtment. There he painted Pêche de nuit à Antibes (fig. 30), a picture based upon the. activities of. ##local fisherman that attracted their nightly catch by acetylene lamps, the lights dra. wing the fish. ##upward from dark waters towards its yellow-green glow. Picasso had often seen the men. at work duri. ##ng his late night walks along the rocky Mediterranean seaboard and the beaches of Juan-l. es-Pins an. ##d Antibes. The two women (Dora Maar and Nusch Eluard) eating ice cream cones on the right. of the sc. ##ene offset the expression of a larger darkness than nighttime fishing that the painting exp. resses.. ##Indicated with the four- pronged “arrow” spear,515 pointed at the fish, the apparent allegor. y of. ##perpetrator and victim is the central theme. A second fisherman identified by an inverted and c. ont. ##orted head is seemingly encased in a black miasma, otherwise, the boat. Stars are reflected in th. e. ##dark waters and between the macrocosm and microcosm of space and sea—the Hermetic maxim,

As above, so below, which Picasso seized in literal and symbo. ##lic te. rms—was made plausible once again.516 The sun’s coiling energy was an illogical element for. ##the nigh. ttime scene in that is not a moon; nonetheless, it’s light produced the bright scene. The. ##palette, h. owever, seems synthetic as if it were taking a cue from the chemical light of the fisher. ##men’s carbid. e lamps.
Picasso’s sun, and by now we understand that he would have claimed it as his,. ##does not appe. ar again in any significant way until 1952.

On the occasion of the installation of his sculpture, L’Homme au Mouton on Au. ##gust 6, 1950, in the m. arket square Picasso was also officially offered to decorate the local Roman. ##esque Cistercian chapel. of the castle that had been deconsecrated since the French Revolution and l. ##eft empty and closed up.. Picasso accepted the grand gesture and later affirmed that his first conce. ##pt for the wall and ceilin. g murals had focused on the Manichean confrontation between the destruct. ##ive powers of war and the id. yllic life under peace.517 Gilot recalled that at the time Picasso had. ##just concluded reading War an. d Peace and that he had derived the theme for the chapel paintings f. ##rom Tolstoy’s masterpiece.

Third of May, 1808, that had in turn. inspired Manet’s Execution of Maximilian in 1876;518 and. ##, certainly Goya may have been present in Pi. casso’s mind during the period that he was working on. ##the Massacre and consequent sketches for the w. ar painting in the peace chapel in Vallauris. During. ##the same period, an exceptionally important exh. ibition of Goya’s etchings was held at the Galerie. ##Paul Ambroise in Paris in December 1950. The pres. entation marked the first time that Goya’s incom. ##parable etchings in the series, Los Desastres de la. Guerra (Disasters of War, 1810-1819); Los Capri. ##chos (The Caprices, 1799) that included the prescient. image for modern times, “The Sleep of Reason. ##Produces Monsters;” La Tauromachia (Bullfighting, 1816. ); and, Los Disparates (The Follies, 1815-18. ##23) had been shown outside Madrid. So important was the. exhibition to the larger conversation in Co. ##mmunist circles that Plate 26 of the Disasters, “No se pu. ede mirar” (One Can’t Look) was published. ##on the front page of the leftist Paris newspaper L’Humanit. e on December 12.519
Yet, Le Massacre e. ##n Corée had failed to win approval by the French Communist Pa. rty. As Utley, the authority on the s. ##ubject explained: “What was considered the ‘violently modern fo. rm’ of the Massacre was anathema to. ##the party’s artistic doctrines. In content too it was deemed pol. itically incorrect. While the Com. ##munists were strong proponents of history painting, and while they. urged artists to focus on the ma. ##sses, what they wanted to see was the heroic fight of the Korean peo. ple and not their passive subm. ##ission to defeat.”520 Picasso had painted another massacre of the inno. cents. This was for him alwa. ##ys the great tragedy of war. In many ways, he was blamed for not creatin. g another Guernica, that i. ##s, a masterpiece, and he was never satisfied to understand just how Massac. re had failed or was a l. ##ack of

Annoyed and obsessed to right the apparent wrong, in beginning Le paix. et le guerre he wou. ##ld not depict victims of war but rather “a fighting work against war.”521 At one. point, Picasso had. ##envisioned the Temple of Peace as a meeting place for young people from different. countries who we. ##re emissaries of peace throughout France, the so-called Caravans de la Paix. 522 Pi. casso was so en. ##thralled with the idea that he envisioned creating a second peace temple near Céret—h. is refuge wit. ##h Braque in 1911 and cite of analytical cubism’s dawning—a village on Catalan soil in t. he Pyrenees. ##, close to the Spanish border.
The war panel, La guerre, was excessively packed with grue. some deta. ##ils of daggers, spears with blood, axes, blood-soaked earth, human suffering magnified by a. half-Mi. ##notaur figure mixed with Picasso’s profile who holds a basket of skulls thrown over its shou. lder.. ##The frieze-like parade of destruction is stopped by a large figure, a war monster that yields. a lar. ##ge shield. But its sign is that of the dove painted in position on the shield where the emperor. or. ##warring god’s visage would normally appear. Peace stops the carnival of war thereby allowing the. se. ##cond part of the work, Le paix, to show those caught in the round of killings and hatred an alter. n. ##ative. I choose not to illustrate the war panel in order to keep focus here upon the suns that now.. ##number three in significant contexts of war, human struggle, and defeat; in parallel realities of li. ##. fe and death; and, in the life-giving potential of the sun which Le paix affirms. In the apocalypt. ##ic. tradition, chaos is the prelude to returning the world to a state prior to its division, back to. ##th. e Garden before good and evil were introduced.
The Peace and War paintings were technically dif. ##ficul. t, painted on fiberboard and then fitted to the 12th century Romanesque ceiling and walls of. ##the cha. pel (fig. 32). Picasso’s precise placement of the sun overhead is not understood in the fla. ##t panel p. aintings. But in

place his intention that the sun beamed down did so from the. ##upper right. half of its place in “the sky.” This sun was made resplendent in prismatic red, yellow. ##, and blue, t. he basic particles of Newtonian white light. If Picasso’s prism-sun emits the pure Ne. ##wtonian light u. ntainted by filaments or allegorical degridations it is a sun that returned to the. ##natural order of. life. Yet, Picasso, the symbolist, would not leave it without signification and if. ##it was no longer. apotropaic, it nevertheless is a sun that continued to see or to watch all the wh. ##ile it was radiant.. Whereas the suns in Guernica took the form of eyes, and the night-sun in Night. ##Fishing in Antibes i. s diagrammatic, the sun in La paix has the characteristics of an aperture. The. ##scaffolded yellow bla. des surround an interior of red, blue, and yellow diaphragms, and behind the. ##m, we see the opening of. pure white of light from which, in the operation of a camera lens, an imag. ##e is captured.
