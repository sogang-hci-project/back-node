Description

An accurate. ##depiction of a cruel, dramatic situation, Guernica was created to be. part of the Spanish Pavilion a. ##t the International Exposition in Paris in 1937. #Pablo Picasso’s. motivation for painting the scene. ##in this great work was the news of the German aerial bombing o. f the Basque town whose name the piece. ##bears, which the artist had seen in the dramatic photograp. hs published in various periodicals, incl. ##uding the French newspaper L'Humanité. #Despite that, n. either the studies nor the finished picture c. ##ontain a single allusion to a specific event, const. ituting instead a generic plea against the barbar. ##ity and terror of war. #The huge picture is con. ceived as a giant poster, testimony to the horror tha. ##t the Spanish Civil War was causing and a f. orewarning of what was to come in the Second World War. #. ##The muted colours, the intensity of eac. h and every one of the motifs and the way they are articulate. ##d are all essential to the extreme. tragedy of the scene, which would become the emblem for all the d. ##evastating tragedies of modern. society. #Guernica has attracted a number of controversial interpreta. ##tions, doubtless due in par. t to the deliberate use in the painting of only greyish tones. #Analysing. ##the iconography in the. painting, one Guernica scholar, Anthony Blunt, divides the protagonists of t. ##he pyramidal composi. tion into two groups, the first of which is made up of three animals; the bull,. ##the wounded horse. and the winged bird that can just be made out in the background on the left. #The. ##second group i. s made up of the human beings, consisting of a dead soldier and a number of women: the. ##one on the. upper right, holding a lamp and leaning through a window, the mother on the left, wailin. ##g as sh. e holds her dead child, the one rushing in from the right and finally the one who is crying o. ##ut. to the heavens, her arms raised as a house burns down behind her. #At this point it should be rem. #. #embered that two years earlier, in 1935, Picasso had done the etching Minotauromaquia, a synthetic. w. ##ork condensing into a single image all the symbols of his cycle dedicated to the mythological c. reatu. ##re, which stands as Guernica’s most direct relative. #Incidents in Picasso’s private life a. nd the po. ##litical events afflicting Europe between the wars fused together in the motifs the pain. ter was using. ##at the time, resulting both in Guernica itself and all the studies and ‘postscripts. ’, regarded as a. ##mong the most representative works of art of the 20th century. #Source
